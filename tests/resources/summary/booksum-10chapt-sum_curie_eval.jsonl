{"text": "\nIt is necessary to consider another point in examining the character of\nthese principalities: that is, whether a prince has such power that, in\ncase of need, he can support himself with his own resources, or whether\nhe has always need of the assistance of others. And to make this quite\nclear I say that I consider those who are able to support themselves by\ntheir own resources who can, either by abundance of men or money, raise\na sufficient army to join battle against any one who comes to attack\nthem; and I consider those always to have need of others who cannot\nshow themselves against the enemy in the field, but are forced to\ndefend themselves by sheltering behind walls. The first case has been\ndiscussed, but we will speak of it again should it recur. In the second\ncase one can say nothing except to encourage such princes to provision\nand fortify their towns, and not on any account to defend the country.\nAnd whoever shall fortify his town well, and shall have managed the\nother concerns of his subjects in the way stated above, and to be often\nrepeated, will never be attacked without great caution, for men are\nalways adverse to enterprises where difficulties can be seen, and it\nwill be seen not to be an easy thing to attack one who has his town well\nfortified, and is not hated by his people.\n\nThe cities of Germany are absolutely free, they own but little country\naround them, and they yield obedience to the emperor when it suits\nthem, nor do they fear this or any other power they may have near them,\nbecause they are fortified in such a way that every one thinks the\ntaking of them by assault would be tedious and difficult, seeing they\nhave proper ditches and walls, they have sufficient artillery, and they\nalways keep in public depots enough for one year's eating, drinking, and\nfiring. And beyond this, to keep the people quiet and without loss to\nthe state, they always have the means of giving work to the community\nin those labours that are the life and strength of the city, and on\nthe pursuit of which the people are supported; they also hold military\nexercises in repute, and moreover have many ordinances to uphold them.\n\nTherefore, a prince who has a strong city, and had not made himself\nodious, will not be attacked, or if any one should attack he will only\nbe driven off with disgrace; again, because that the affairs of this\nworld are so changeable, it is almost impossible to keep an army a whole\nyear in the field without being interfered with. And whoever should\nreply: If the people have property outside the city, and see it burnt,\nthey will not remain patient, and the long siege and self-interest will\nmake them forget their prince; to this I answer that a powerful and\ncourageous prince will overcome all such difficulties by giving at one\ntime hope to his subjects that the evil will not be for long, at another\ntime fear of the cruelty of the enemy, then preserving himself adroitly\nfrom those subjects who seem to him to be too bold.\n\nFurther, the enemy would naturally on his arrival at once burn and ruin\nthe country at the time when the spirits of the people are still hot and\nready for the defence; and, therefore, so much the less ought the prince\nto hesitate; because after a time, when spirits have cooled, the damage\nis already done, the ills are incurred, and there is no longer any\nremedy; and therefore they are so much the more ready to unite with\ntheir prince, he appearing to be under obligations to them now that\ntheir houses have been burnt and their possessions ruined in his\ndefence. For it is the nature of men to be bound by the benefits they\nconfer as much as by those they receive. Therefore, if everything is\nwell considered, it will not be difficult for a wise prince to keep the\nminds of his citizens steadfast from first to last, when he does not\nfail to support and defend them.\n\n\n\n", "summary": "Chapter X is entitled \"How to Measure the Strength of Any Prince's State. Here Machiavelli adopts a decidedly militaristic tone. Princes, he writes, are better off when they can assemble an army and stand up against attackers; once again, Cesare Borgia is cited as a perfect example. Machiavelli addresses the majority of this chapter to the other class of princes: \"those who can't take the field against their foes, but have to hide behind their walls and defend themselves there. What should these more vulnerable princes do. They should keep their cities well-fortified; they should ignore the rural areas and focus their defense efforts on the urban centers; and they should be careful not to earn the people's hatred. A prudent prince is able to keep his subjects loyal to him and in good spirits during a siege. The burden during a siege is often on the besieger; he can almost never afford to wage a siege and do nothing else for a year. Defense, therefore, can consist of slowing the attacker down, wearing him out. Machiavelli cites the cities in Germany as examples of good fortification. These cities have moats, walls, artillery, public warehouses of food, drink, and fuel, and large supplies of raw materials in reserve to keep workers busy and economies going during a siege", "metadata": {"bid": 1232, "is_aggregate": false, "source": "gradesaver", "chapter_path": "all_chapterized_books/1232-chapters/10.txt", "summary_path": "finished_summaries/gradesaver/The Prince/section_3_part_1.txt", "book_id": "The Prince.chapter x", "summary_id": "chapter x", "chapter_length": 647, "summary_name": "Chapter X", "summary_url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20210417004655/https://www.gradesaver.com/the-prince/study-guide/summary-section-4-chapters-x-xi", "summary_analysis": "Leo was a Medici, and Machiavelli's compliment of him is obviously half-hearted; it seems to barely disguise Machiavelli's contempt for the Church. It is not for nothing that Machiavelli is so often dubbed a \"secular\" humanist: his focus on the free will of princes, the ways in which their own characters and decisions dictate the success or failure of their reigns, implicitly rejects any notion of divine rule. But The Prince was written for a Medici, in part as a way of currying favor with the family, and Machiavelli therefore had to be sure to refer to Pope Leo only in glowing terms. And yet, when one compares his praise of the pope to his praise of other political leaders, the former pales in comparison. The \"countless other talents\" are not enumerated, and there is more emphasis on the greatness of \"predecessors\" than on that of the Pope himself. It is also intriguing that Machiavelli should follow a chapter explicitly devoted to fortifying cities and other such military matters with one on ecclesiastical states - which, he notes, find such strength in religion that they hardly need to be unified or defended by force. \"These are the only princes,\" Machiavelli notes, \"who have states that they do not defend and subjects that they do not govern; the states, though undefended, are never taken from them, and the subjects, though ungoverned, neither protest, not try to break away, nor could revolt if they had a mind to.\" Machiavelli continues with a dismissal of such states, though admittedly \"happy and safe governments,\" as undeserving of his interest: \"But since they are ruled by a heavenly providence to which human reason cannot reach, I shall say nothing of them. Instituted as they are by God, and sustained by him, it would be a rash and imprudent man who ventured to discuss them.\" Machiavelli is drawing a clear distinction between that which men can control and that which they cannot - a topic that he delves into at greater length later in The Prince. For now, there is much to be considered in his assertion that the subjects of an ecclesiastical state could not \"revolt if they had a mind to.\" Why not? On the one hand, Machiavelli implicitly accepts the Church as a purveyor of divinity; these states are indeed \"instituted\" by God, and are thus beyond analysis. On the other hand, his earlier examination of various popes' political maneuvers and the machinations at play within the Church  belies such an uncritical view. There also remains the following question: does Machiavelli distance himself from the Church as a subject of analysis and critique because it is divine and therefore beyond fault, or because he is uninterested in it? The focus of so much of The Prince - and a prevalent theme throughout the Renaissance - is reason. Machiavelli continually refers to the \"prudent\" prince; he outlines the choices that face a prince, and addresses decisions as if he were speaking of medicine - even going so far as to compare pre-emptive war to a doctor treating a malady before it has time to grow and worsen. Power, for Machiavelli, can be attained purely through the faculties of the mind. Yes, armies are necessary, friends in high places can help, and luck plays a role, but it takes reason to determine what kind of army to use, to know when and when not to rely on friends, to know who to trust, and to know how to harness the vicissitudes of fortune. When Machiavelli writes that \"human reason\" cannot reach a certain state or kingdom, he therefore may be delivering a not-so-veiled insult not to religion itself, but to the state. These hints are buttressed by Machiavelli's other writings. In his famous Discorsi, for example, Machiavelli lambasts the Church's role in politics, bemoaning its decadence and writing, \"And certainly, if the Christian religion had from the beginning been maintained according to the principles of its founder, the Christian states and republics would be much more united and happy than in fact they are.\" At the same time, Machiavelli does argue that religion deserves an importance place in society.

{"text": "\nIt only remains now to speak of ecclesiastical principalities, touching\nwhich all difficulties are prior to getting possession, because they\nare acquired either by capacity or good fortune, and they can be held\nwithout either; for they are sustained by the ancient ordinances of\nreligion, which are so all-powerful, and of such a character that the\nprincipalities may be held no matter how their princes behave and live.\nThese princes alone have states and do not defend them; and they have\nsubjects and do not rule them; and the states, although unguarded, are\nnot taken from them, and the subjects, although not ruled, do not care,\nand they have neither the desire nor the ability to alienate themselves.\nSuch principalities only are secure and happy. But being upheld by\npowers, to which the human mind cannot reach, I shall speak no more of\nthem, because, being exalted and maintained by God, it would be the act\nof a presumptuous and rash man to discuss them.\n\nNevertheless, if any one should ask of me how comes it that the\nChurch has attained such greatness in temporal power, seeing that from\nAlexander backwards the Italian potentates (not only those who have been\ncalled potentates, but every baron and lord, though the smallest)\nhave valued the temporal power very slightly--yet now a king of France\ntrembles before it, and it has been able to drive him from Italy, and\nto ruin the Venetians--although this may be very manifest, it does not\nappear to me superfluous to recall it in some measure to memory.\n\nBefore Charles, King of France, passed into Italy,(*) this country was\nunder the dominion of the Pope, the Venetians, the King of Naples, the\nDuke of Milan, and the Florentines. These potentates had two principal\nanxieties: the one, that no foreigner should enter Italy under arms; the\nother, that none of themselves should seize more territory. Those about\nwhom there was the most anxiety were the Pope and the Venetians. To\nrestrain the Venetians the union of all the others was necessary, as it\nwas for the defence of Ferrara; and to keep down the Pope they made use\nof the barons of Rome, who, being divided into two factions, Orsini and\nColonnesi, had always a pretext for disorder, and, standing with arms in\ntheir hands under the eyes of the Pontiff, kept the pontificate weak and\npowerless. And although there might arise sometimes a courageous pope,\nsuch as Sixtus, yet neither fortune nor wisdom could rid him of these\nannoyances. And the short life of a pope is also a cause of weakness;\nfor in the ten years, which is the average life of a pope, he can with\ndifficulty lower one of the factions; and if, so to speak, one people\nshould almost destroy the Colonnesi, another would arise hostile to the\nOrsini, who would support their opponents, and yet would not have time\nto ruin the Orsini. This was the reason why the temporal powers of the\npope were little esteemed in Italy.\n\n     (*) Charles VIII invaded Italy in 1494.\n\nAlexander the Sixth arose afterwards, who of all the pontiffs that\nhave ever been showed how a pope with both money and arms was able to\nprevail; and through the instrumentality of the Duke Valentino, and by\nreason of the entry of the French, he brought about all those things\nwhich I have discussed above in the actions of the duke. And although\nhis intention was not to aggrandize the Church, but the duke,\nnevertheless, what he did contributed to the greatness of the Church,\nwhich, after his death and the ruin of the duke, became the heir to all\nhis labours.\n\nPope Julius came afterwards and found the Church strong, possessing all\nthe Romagna, the barons of Rome reduced to impotence, and, through the\nchastisements of Alexander, the factions wiped out; he also found\nthe way open to accumulate money in a manner such as had never been\npractised before Alexander's time. Such things Julius not only followed,\nbut improved upon, and he intended to gain Bologna, to ruin the\nVenetians, and to drive the French out of Italy. All of these\nenterprises prospered with him, and so much the more to his credit,\ninasmuch as he did everything to strengthen the Church and not any\nprivate person. He kept also the Orsini and Colonnesi factions within\nthe bounds in which he found them; and although there was among them\nsome mind to make disturbance, nevertheless he held two things firm: the\none, the greatness of the Church, with which he terrified them; and the\nother, not allowing them to have their own cardinals, who caused the\ndisorders among them. For whenever these factions have their cardinals\nthey do not remain quiet for long, because cardinals foster the factions\nin Rome and out of it, and the barons are compelled to support them, and\nthus from the ambitions of prelates arise disorders and tumults among\nthe barons. For these reasons his Holiness Pope Leo(*) found the\npontificate most powerful, and it is to be hoped that, if others made it\ngreat in arms, he will make it still greater and more venerated by his\ngoodness and infinite other virtues.\n\n\n", "summary": "\"Of Ecclesiastical States,\" primarily concerns the Papal States. Religious bodies politic are, in general, easy to hold onto; religion itself sustains them, and they hardly need to be defended or governed. Still, the Church had a hard time securing power in Italy, largely because popes tended to only live for ten years or so - not enough time to exact any lasting change. Moreover, Rome was divided by hostile factions, most prominently the Orsini and Colonna families. Today, Machiavelli notes, the papacy awes France, and was able to kick King Louis out of Italy and \"ruin the Venetians at the same time. How did this happen. It really began, Machiavelli argues, with Pope Alexander VI. Alexander strategically used his son Cesare Borgia to strengthen his own power. Admittedly, Alexander likely intended only to give his son more power; but the moves wound up strengthening the papacy, and as a result Rome emerged as more united, and less threatened by factions. Pope Julius continued Alexander's efforts. He took Bologna, crushed the Venetians, ran the French out of Italy, and kept Orsini and Colonna weak. Machiavelli concludes his chapter by mentioning the current pope, Leo. These are the reasons,\" he writes, \"why his present holiness Pope Leo has found the papacy so strong; and we may hope that as his predecessors made it great by force of arms, he by his generosity and countless other talents will make it even greater and more to be revered", "metadata": {"bid": 1232, "is_aggregate": false, "source": "gradesaver", "chapter_path": "all_chapterized_books/1232-chapters/11.txt", "summary_path": "finished_summaries/gradesaver/The Prince/section_3_part_2.txt", "book_id": "The Prince.chapter xi", "summary_id": "chapter xi", "chapter_length": 805, "summary_name": "Chapter XI", "summary_url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20210417004655/https://www.gradesaver.com/the-prince/study-guide/summary-section-4-chapters-x-xi", "summary_analysis": "Leo was a Medici, and Machiavelli's compliment of him is obviously half-hearted; it seems to barely disguise Machiavelli's contempt for the Church.

And as I know that many have written on\nthis point, I expect I shall be considered presumptuous in mentioning it\nagain, especially as in discussing it I shall depart from the methods of\nother people. But, it being my intention to write a thing which shall\nbe useful to him who apprehends it, it appears to me more appropriate to\nfollow up the real truth of the matter than the imagination of it; for\nmany have pictured republics and principalities which in fact have never\nbeen known or seen, because how one lives is so far distant from how one\nought to live, that he who neglects what is done for what ought to\nbe done, sooner effects his ruin than his preservation; for a man who\nwishes to act entirely up to his professions of virtue soon meets with\nwhat destroys him among so much that is evil.\n\nHence it is necessary for a prince wishing to hold his own to know\nhow to do wrong, and to make use of it or not according to necessity.\nTherefore, putting on one side imaginary things concerning a prince, and\ndiscussing those which are real, I say that all men when they are spoken\nof, and chiefly princes for being more highly placed, are remarkable\nfor some of those qualities which bring them either blame or praise; and\nthus it is that one is reputed liberal, another miserly, using a Tuscan\nterm (because an avaricious person in our language is still he who\ndesires to possess by robbery, whilst we call one miserly who deprives\nhimself too much of the use of his own); one is reputed generous,\none rapacious; one cruel, one compassionate; one faithless, another\nfaithful; one effeminate and cowardly, another bold and brave; one\naffable, another haughty; one lascivious, another chaste; one sincere,\nanother cunning; one hard, another easy; one grave, another frivolous;\none religious, another unbelieving, and the like. And I know that every\none will confess that it would be most praiseworthy in a prince to\nexhibit all the above qualities that are considered good; but because\nthey can neither be entirely possessed nor observed, for human\nconditions do not permit it, it is necessary for him to be sufficiently\nprudent that he may know how to avoid the reproach of those vices which\nwould lose him his state; and also to keep himself, if it be possible,\nfrom those which would not lose him it; but this not being possible, he\nmay with less hesitation abandon himself to them. And again, he need\nnot make himself uneasy at incurring a reproach for those vices without\nwhich the state can only be saved with difficulty, for if everything is\nconsidered carefully, it will be found that something which looks like\nvirtue, if followed, would be his ruin; whilst something else, which\nlooks like vice, yet followed brings him security and prosperity.\n\n\n\n", "summary": "\"On the Reasons Why Men Are Praised or Blamed - Especially Princes,\" Machiavelli argues that a prince should be good as long as that goodness is politically useful. It is impossible for a prince to be perfect and to exercise all virtues; therefore, he should not worry about guarding against vices that will not cost him his state. He should avoid those vices that lead to the kind of disgrace that could precipitate a fall from power, but while he should try to avoid those vices that are not as damaging, if he cannot prevent them, he is allowed to indulge them", "metadata": {"bid": 1232, "is_aggregate": false, "source": "gradesaver", "chapter_path": "all_chapterized_books/1232-chapters/15.txt", "summary_path": "finished_summaries/gradesaver/The Prince/section_5_part_1.txt", "book_id": "The Prince.chapter xv", "summary_id": "chapter xv", "chapter_length": 466, "summary_name": "Chapter XV", "summary_url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20210417004655/https://www.gradesaver.com/the-prince/study-guide/summary-section-6-chapters-xv-xix", "summary_analysis": "If The Prince is often characterized as a treatise on unscrupulous politics and a manual of ruthless power games, Chapter XV, \"On the Reasons Why Men Are Praised or Blamed - Especially Princes,\" is a particularly crucial chapter. It is here that Machiavelli directly addresses the question that has been bubbling underneath the surface of his book thus far - namely, to what extent does being good matter? Machiavelli's answer: as long as it contributes to holding onto power. The key notion here is that good is a relative concept; surface virtuosity, of the kind often showcased by rulers, is often but a disguise, and the greatest good lies in the end - the all-inclusive goal of maintaining the state and securing the reins of power. In other words, good is good insofar as it is politically expedient. The categorical crumbles in the face of efficiency, for the latter is the only true barometer. The ends justify the means, and utilitarianism  is the dominant mode of reasoning. If a prince needs to indulge a vice to save his state, so be it. \"For if you look at matters carefully,\" Machiavelli writes, \"you will see that something resembling virtue, if you follow it, may be your ruin, while something resembling vice will lead, if you follow it, to your security and well-being.\" One might compare this argument to the thrust of Chapter XIII, \"On Those Who Have Become Princes By Crime,\" which measures when and to what extent a prince's cruelty can be justified. Machiavelli is arguing something far more complex than a call to disregard morality. His example of the generous prince begins as a seemingly hard-lined argument and emerges as a humanist consideration of the faults of man. A prince should not be miserly just for the sake of it; miserliness, by resulting in the safeguarding of funds and greater financial security, winds up helping the people in quite direct ways. It is up to the prince to see beyond short-run desires and superficial appearances and to not give away money he cannot afford to spend just to put on a lovable face and to curry favor, but instead to weather the occasional criticism and plan for the future. It is all about the greater good. Machiavelli sublimates the individualistic treatment of the prince as solitary agent into a larger view of society as contingent on long-term planning and sacrifice. The Prince reads here as less a how-to for the aspiring prince than a social manifesto; Machiavelli puts faith in the people's judgment, arguing that they will come around to loving the miserly prince who saves money out of necessity. As in his earlier distinctions between the common people and the nobles, he emerges as more of a populist and democrat than popular conceptions of The Prince tend to allow for. That said, Chapter XVII, \"On Cruelty and Clemency,\" presents a thoroughly pessimistic view of humanity. Men are inherently \"rotten,\" Machiavelli argues, explaining that they are \"ungrateful, fickle, liars and deceivers, fearful of danger and greedy for gain.\" For this reason, it is safer for a prince to be feared than to be loved: \"love is link of obligation which men, because they are rotten, will break any time they think doing so serves their advantage.\" Fear, on the other hand, \"involves dread of punishment, from which they can never escape.\" As always, Machiavelli tempers what seems at first like a thoroughly cynical position, noting that moderation is the key, and that a prince should try to make himself feared in a way that does not make him hated. More specifically, he should only shed blood when he has good reason to, he should not confiscate property, and he should keep his hands off his subjects' women. Certain lines cannot be crossed. As Machiavelli writes a few pages later, a prince \"should be ready to enter on evil if he has to,\" but he must have to.  In any case, virtues are often difficult to define; they are only virtuous insofar as they help people. Virtue for its own sake can be harmful, and for a prince to possess and exercise all virtues at all times is a mistake. Appearances are a different matter: the masses are impressed by the superficial appearance of things so long as the prince's ends are achieved. It matters little, therefore, who the prince really is. Machiavelli closes Chapter XVIII with a reference that deserves mention. \"A certain prince of our own time,\" he writes, \"whom it's just as well not to name, preaches nothing but peace and mutual trust, yet he is the determined enemy of both.\" This seems to be a condemnation, but Machiavelli continues: \"if on several different occasions he had observed either, he would have lost both his reputation and his throne.\" The prince in question is Ferdinand of Spain, and the passage is something of a swipe at him. The first line suggests untempered scorn, while the second modifies this position and recasts Ferdinand as an example of how hypocrisy can be useful. These last few words are perhaps the veil Machiavelli uses to hide a more acute criticism of Ferdinand, who secured his power through often bloodthirsty tactics, expelling the Muslims and Jews from Spain, waging war, and persecuting the masses. These repellent maneuvers, Machiavelli is forced to admit, did work. We can sense here the writer having reached a sort of theoretical impasse: how to both condemn and praise? How to reconcile a need for human goodness  with the demands of power and the vicissitudes of international relations?

{"text": "\nCommencing then with the first of the above-named characteristics, I say\nthat it would be well to be reputed liberal. Nevertheless, liberality\nexercised in a way that does not bring you the reputation for it,\ninjures you; for if one exercises it honestly and as it should be\nexercised, it may not become known, and you will not avoid the reproach\nof its opposite. Therefore, any one wishing to maintain among men the\nname of liberal is obliged to avoid no attribute of magnificence; so\nthat a prince thus inclined will consume in such acts all his property,\nand will be compelled in the end, if he wish to maintain the name\nof liberal, to unduly weigh down his people, and tax them, and do\neverything he can to get money. This will soon make him odious to his\nsubjects, and becoming poor he will be little valued by any one; thus,\nwith his liberality, having offended many and rewarded few, he is\naffected by the very first trouble and imperilled by whatever may be the\nfirst danger; recognizing this himself, and wishing to draw back from\nit, he runs at once into the reproach of being miserly.\n\nTherefore, a prince, not being able to exercise this virtue of\nliberality in such a way that it is recognized, except to his cost, if\nhe is wise he ought not to fear the reputation of being mean, for in\ntime he will come to be more considered than if liberal, seeing that\nwith his economy his revenues are enough, that he can defend himself\nagainst all attacks, and is able to engage in enterprises without\nburdening his people; thus it comes to pass that he exercises liberality\ntowards all from whom he does not take, who are numberless, and meanness\ntowards those to whom he does not give, who are few.\n\nWe have not seen great things done in our time except by those who have\nbeen considered mean; the rest have failed. Pope Julius the Second was\nassisted in reaching the papacy by a reputation for liberality, yet he\ndid not strive afterwards to keep it up, when he made war on the King of\nFrance; and he made many wars without imposing any extraordinary tax on\nhis subjects, for he supplied his additional expenses out of his long\nthriftiness. The present King of Spain would not have undertaken or\nconquered in so many enterprises if he had been reputed liberal. A\nprince, therefore, provided that he has not to rob his subjects, that he\ncan defend himself, that he does not become poor and abject, that he\nis not forced to become rapacious, ought to hold of little account\na reputation for being mean, for it is one of those vices which will\nenable him to govern.\n\nAnd if any one should say: Caesar obtained empire by liberality, and\nmany others have reached the highest positions by having been liberal,\nand by being considered so, I answer: Either you are a prince in\nfact, or in a way to become one. In the first case this liberality is\ndangerous, in the second it is very necessary to be considered liberal;\nand Caesar was one of those who wished to become pre-eminent in Rome;\nbut if he had survived after becoming so, and had not moderated his\nexpenses, he would have destroyed his government. And if any one should\nreply: Many have been princes, and have done great things with armies,\nwho have been considered very liberal, I reply: Either a prince spends\nthat which is his own or his subjects' or else that of others. In the\nfirst case he ought to be sparing, in the second he ought not to neglect\nany opportunity for liberality. And to the prince who goes forth with\nhis army, supporting it by pillage, sack, and extortion, handling that\nwhich belongs to others, this liberality is necessary, otherwise he\nwould not be followed by soldiers. And of that which is neither yours\nnor your subjects' you can be a ready giver, as were Cyrus, Caesar, and\nAlexander; because it does not take away your reputation if you squander\nthat of others, but adds to it; it is only squandering your own that\ninjures you.\n\nAnd there is nothing wastes so rapidly as liberality, for even whilst\nyou exercise it you lose the power to do so, and so become either poor\nor despised, or else, in avoiding poverty, rapacious and hated. And a\nprince should guard himself, above all things, against being despised\nand hated; and liberality leads you to both. Therefore it is wiser to\nhave a reputation for meanness which brings reproach without hatred,\nthan to be compelled through seeking a reputation for liberality to\nincur a name for rapacity which begets reproach with hatred.\n\n\n\n", "summary": "\"On Liberality and Stinginess,\" Machiavelli complicates what initially seems like a relatively unfettered apologia for unscrupulous politics. His underlying point seems to be that virtue in office is often just a sham; true virtue is not seen and has no ulterior motive, whereas visible virtue is often exhibited only so that the prince may be loved and maintain a virtuous reputation. For example, the ostentatiously generous prince, in order to keep his \"generosity\" up, will have to burden the people with \"exorbitant taxes and squeeze money out of them in every way he can\" once he has used up his own revenue. This will in turn make him hated, so that his generosity will have backfired. What Machiavelli seems to object to is careless spending; better for a prince to be thought a \"miser,\" for his parsimony will enable him to live on his income, not raise taxes, and defend against enemies, all of which will in turn earn him greater respect in the long run. Hence a prince who prefers not to rob his subjects,\" Machiavelli writes, \"who wants to be able to defend himself, who wants to avoid poverty and contempt, and who doesn't want to become a plunderer, should not mind in the least if people consider him a miser; this is simply one of the vices that enable him to reign. Machiavelli concludes that when a citizen is trying to rise to princedom, generosity is important; thereafter, it is harmful", "metadata": {"bid": 1232, "is_aggregate": false, "source": "gradesaver", "chapter_path": "all_chapterized_books/1232-chapters/16.txt", "summary_path": "finished_summaries/gradesaver/The Prince/section_5_part_2.txt", "book_id": "The Prince.chapter xvi", "summary_id": "chapter xvi", "chapter_length": 739, "summary_name": "Chapter XVI", "summary_url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20210417004655/https://www.gradesaver.com/the-prince/study-guide/summary-section-6-chapters-xv-xix", "summary_analysis": "If The Prince is often characterized as a treatise on unscrupulous politics and a manual of ruthless power games, Chapter XV, \"On the Reasons Why Men Are Praised or Blamed - Especially Princes,\" is a particularly crucial chapter. It is here that Machiavelli directly addresses the question that has been bubbling underneath the surface of his book thus far - namely, to what extent does being good matter? Machiavelli's answer: as long as it contributes to holding onto power. The key notion here is that good is a relative concept; surface virtuosity, of the kind often showcased by rulers, is often but a disguise, and the greatest good lies in the end - the all-inclusive goal of maintaining the state and securing the reins of power. In other words, good is good insofar as it is politically expedient. The categorical crumbles in the face of efficiency, for the latter is the only true barometer. The ends justify the means, and utilitarianism  is the dominant mode of reasoning. If a prince needs to indulge a vice to save his state, so be it. \"For if you look at matters carefully,\" Machiavelli writes, \"you will see that something resembling virtue, if you follow it, may be your ruin, while something resembling vice will lead, if you follow it, to your security and well-being.\" One might compare this argument to the thrust of Chapter XIII, \"On Those Who Have Become Princes By Crime,\" which measures when and to what extent a prince's cruelty can be justified. Machiavelli is arguing something far more complex than a call to disregard morality. His example of the generous prince begins as a seemingly hard-lined argument and emerges as a humanist consideration of the faults of man. A prince should not be miserly just for the sake of it; miserliness, by resulting in the safeguarding of funds and greater financial security, winds up helping the people in quite direct ways. It is up to the prince to see beyond short-run desires and superficial appearances and to not give away money he cannot afford to spend just to put on a lovable face and to curry favor, but instead to weather the occasional criticism and plan for the future. It is all about the greater good. Machiavelli sublimates the individualistic treatment of the prince as solitary agent into a larger view of society as contingent on long-term planning and sacrifice. The Prince reads here as less a how-to for the aspiring prince than a social manifesto; Machiavelli puts faith in the people's judgment, arguing that they will come around to loving the miserly prince who saves money out of necessity. As in his earlier distinctions between the common people and the nobles, he emerges as more of a populist and democrat than popular conceptions of The Prince tend to allow for. That said, Chapter XVII, \"On Cruelty and Clemency,\" presents a thoroughly pessimistic view of humanity. Men are inherently \"rotten,\" Machiavelli argues, explaining that they are \"ungrateful, fickle, liars and deceivers, fearful of danger and greedy for gain.\" For this reason, it is safer for a prince to be feared than to be loved: \"love is link of obligation which men, because they are rotten, will break any time they think doing so serves their advantage.\" Fear, on the other hand, \"involves dread of punishment, from which they can never escape.\" As always, Machiavelli tempers what seems at first like a thoroughly cynical position, noting that moderation is the key, and that a prince should try to make himself feared in a way that does not make him hated. More specifically, he should only shed blood when he has good reason to, he should not confiscate property, and he should keep his hands off his subjects' women. Certain lines cannot be crossed. As Machiavelli writes a few pages later, a prince \"should be ready to enter on evil if he has to,\" but he must have to.  In any case, virtues are often difficult to define; they are only virtuous insofar as they help people. Virtue for its own sake can be harmful, and for a prince to possess and exercise all virtues at all times is a mistake. Appearances are a different matter: the masses are impressed by the superficial appearance of things so long as the prince's ends are achieved. It matters little, therefore, who the prince really is. Machiavelli closes Chapter XVIII with a reference that deserves mention. \"A certain prince of our own time,\" he writes, \"whom it's just as well not to name, preaches nothing but peace and mutual trust, yet he is the determined enemy of both.\" This seems to be a condemnation, but Machiavelli continues: \"if on several different occasions he had observed either, he would have lost both his reputation and his throne.\" The prince in question is Ferdinand of Spain, and the passage is something of a swipe at him. The first line suggests untempered scorn, while the second modifies this position and recasts Ferdinand as an example of how hypocrisy can be useful. These last few words are perhaps the veil Machiavelli uses to hide a more acute criticism of Ferdinand, who secured his power through often bloodthirsty tactics, expelling the Muslims and Jews from Spain, waging war, and persecuting the masses. These repellent maneuvers, Machiavelli is forced to admit, did work. We can sense here the writer having reached a sort of theoretical impasse: how to both condemn and praise? How to reconcile a need for human goodness  with the demands of power and the vicissitudes of international relations? Ferdinand provides a particularly difficult case, since Machiavelli, writing of him as a \"determined enemy\" of peace and trust, seems to disapprove of him, while his own writings provide a framework whereby Ferdinand's actions are thoroughly justifiable.

{"text": "Coming now to the other qualities mentioned above, I say that every\nprince ought to desire to be considered clement and not cruel.\nNevertheless he ought to take care not to misuse this clemency. Cesare\nBorgia was considered cruel; notwithstanding, his cruelty reconciled the\nRomagna, unified it, and restored it to peace and loyalty. And if this\nbe rightly considered, he will be seen to have been much more merciful\nthan the Florentine people, who, to avoid a reputation for cruelty,\npermitted Pistoia to be destroyed.(*) Therefore a prince, so long as he\nkeeps his subjects united and loyal, ought not to mind the reproach of\ncruelty; because with a few examples he will be more merciful than those\nwho, through too much mercy, allow disorders to arise, from which follow\nmurders or robberies; for these are wont to injure the whole people,\nwhilst those executions which originate with a prince offend the\nindividual only.\n\n     (*) During the rioting between the Cancellieri and\n     Panciatichi factions in 1502 and 1503.\n\nAnd of all princes, it is impossible for the new prince to avoid the\nimputation of cruelty, owing to new states being full of dangers. Hence\nVirgil, through the mouth of Dido, excuses the inhumanity of her reign\nowing to its being new, saying:\n\n     \"Res dura, et regni novitas me talia cogunt\n     Moliri, et late fines custode tueri.\"(*)\n\nNevertheless he ought to be slow to believe and to act, nor should he\nhimself show fear, but proceed in a temperate manner with prudence and\nhumanity, so that too much confidence may not make him incautious and\ntoo much distrust render him intolerable.\n\n     (*) . . . against my will, my fate\n     A throne unsettled, and an infant state,\n     Bid me defend my realms with all my pow'rs,\n     And guard with these severities my shores.\n\n     Christopher Pitt.\n\nUpon this a question arises: whether it be better to be loved than\nfeared or feared than loved? It may be answered that one should wish to\nbe both, but, because it is difficult to unite them in one person, it\nis much safer to be feared than loved, when, of the two, either must be\ndispensed with. Because this is to be asserted in general of men, that\nthey are ungrateful, fickle, false, cowardly, covetous, and as long as\nyou succeed they are yours entirely; they will offer you their blood,\nproperty, life, and children, as is said above, when the need is far\ndistant; but when it approaches they turn against you. And that\nprince who, relying entirely on their promises, has neglected other\nprecautions, is ruined; because friendships that are obtained by\npayments, and not by greatness or nobility of mind, may indeed be\nearned, but they are not secured, and in time of need cannot be relied\nupon; and men have less scruple in offending one who is beloved than one\nwho is feared, for love is preserved by the link of obligation which,\nowing to the baseness of men, is broken at every opportunity for their\nadvantage; but fear preserves you by a dread of punishment which never\nfails.\n\nNevertheless a prince ought to inspire fear in such a way that, if he\ndoes not win love, he avoids hatred; because he can endure very well\nbeing feared whilst he is not hated, which will always be as long as he\nabstains from the property of his citizens and subjects and from their\nwomen. But when it is necessary for him to proceed against the life of\nsomeone, he must do it on proper justification and for manifest cause,\nbut above all things he must keep his hands off the property of others,\nbecause men more quickly forget the death of their father than the loss\nof their patrimony. Besides, pretexts for taking away the property are\nnever wanting; for he who has once begun to live by robbery will always\nfind pretexts for seizing what belongs to others; but reasons for taking\nlife, on the contrary, are more difficult to find and sooner lapse. But\nwhen a prince is with his army, and has under control a multitude of\nsoldiers, then it is quite necessary for him to disregard the reputation\nof cruelty, for without it he would never hold his army united or\ndisposed to its duties.\n\nAmong the wonderful deeds of Hannibal this one is enumerated: that\nhaving led an enormous army, composed of many various races of men,\nto fight in foreign lands, no dissensions arose either among them or\nagainst the prince, whether in his bad or in his good fortune. This\narose from nothing else than his inhuman cruelty, which, with his\nboundless valour, made him revered and terrible in the sight of\nhis soldiers, but without that cruelty, his other virtues were not\nsufficient to produce this effect. And short-sighted writers admire\nhis deeds from one point of view and from another condemn the principal\ncause of them. That it is true his other virtues would not have been\nsufficient for him may be proved by the case of Scipio, that most\nexcellent man, not only of his own times but within the memory of man,\nagainst whom, nevertheless, his army rebelled in Spain; this arose from\nnothing but his too great forbearance, which gave his soldiers more\nlicense than is consistent with military discipline. For this he was\nupbraided in the Senate by Fabius Maximus, and called the corrupter of\nthe Roman soldiery. The Locrians were laid waste by a legate of Scipio,\nyet they were not avenged by him, nor was the insolence of the legate\npunished, owing entirely to his easy nature. Insomuch that someone in\nthe Senate, wishing to excuse him, said there were many men who knew\nmuch better how not to err than to correct the errors of others.\nThis disposition, if he had been continued in the command, would have\ndestroyed in time the fame and glory of Scipio; but, he being under the\ncontrol of the Senate, this injurious characteristic not only concealed\nitself, but contributed to his glory.\n\nReturning to the question of being feared or loved, I come to the\nconclusion that, men loving according to their own will and fearing\naccording to that of the prince, a wise prince should establish himself\non that which is in his own control and not in that of others; he must\nendeavour only to avoid hatred, as is noted.\n\n\n", "summary": "\"On Cruelty and Clemency: Whether It Is Better To Be Loved or Feared,\" posits the seemingly simple argument that, though it is ideally better to be merciful than cruel, clemency should be handled in moderation. Again, Machiavelli complicates the notion of good as purely subordinate to power, invoking utilitarian reasoning to argue that an excess of \"good\" can actually lead to harm. this case, too much clemency can lead to uprisings and civil war. Machiavelli cites the example of Florence, which was afraid to intervene with the required force in Pistoia and was in turn destroyed through civil conflict. If a prince needs to be cruel to keep his subjects united and loyal, so be it. Cruelty can serve the greater good. There are two ways of fighting, Machiavelli asserts in the following chapter, \"The Way Princes Should Keep Their Word\": with laws, and with force. The first is the human method, and the second belongs in theory to the beasts. That said, there are times when the first method does not suffice, in which case a prince needs to rely on force. Therefore, a prince should study the art of both laws and war, the methods of both man and beasts. When it comes to beasts, two models exist: the lion, which represents brute force and strength, and the fox, which represents wiliness. A prince needs both, for one without the other will lead only to ruin. Machiavelli, as might be expected, proceeds to focus on the fox: \"a prudent prince cannot and should not keep his word when to do so would go against his interest. To be crafty and to be able to deceive, the mythical hallmarks of the fox, are key skills for any ruler. You can break promises and treaties as long as you can hide your duplicity; you must therefore be \"a great liar and hypocrite. A prince need not possess all the virtues listed in Chapter XV. He need not be giving, merciful, faithful, spirited, humane, chaste, straightforward, gentle, but he needs to seem to possess these virtues. Admittedly, it is good to follow virtues both in appearance and in reality, but a prince must be able to switch to the contrary at a moment's notice if necessary, while maintaining a consistent front", "metadata": {"bid": 1232, "is_aggregate": false, "source": "gradesaver", "chapter_path": "all_chapterized_books/1232-chapters/17.txt", "summary_path": "finished_summaries/gradesaver/The Prince/section_5_part_3.txt", "book_id": "The Prince.chapter xvii", "summary_id": "chapter xvii", "chapter_length": 1025, "summary_name": "Chapter XVII", "summary_url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20210417004655/https://www.gradesaver.com/the-prince/study-guide/summary-section-6-chapters-xv-xix", "summary_analysis": "If The Prince is often characterized as a treatise on unscrupulous politics and a manual of ruthless power games, Chapter XV, \"On the Reasons Why Men Are Praised or Blamed - Especially Princes,\" is a particularly crucial chapter.

{"text": "\nNow, concerning the characteristics of which mention is made above, I\nhave spoken of the more important ones, the others I wish to discuss\nbriefly under this generality, that the prince must consider, as has\nbeen in part said before, how to avoid those things which will make him\nhated or contemptible; and as often as he shall have succeeded he\nwill have fulfilled his part, and he need not fear any danger in other\nreproaches.\n\nIt makes him hated above all things, as I have said, to be rapacious,\nand to be a violator of the property and women of his subjects, from\nboth of which he must abstain. And when neither their property nor their\nhonor is touched, the majority of men live content, and he has only to\ncontend with the ambition of a few, whom he can curb with ease in many\nways.\n\nIt makes him contemptible to be considered fickle, frivolous,\neffeminate, mean-spirited, irresolute, from all of which a prince should\nguard himself as from a rock; and he should endeavour to show in his\nactions greatness, courage, gravity, and fortitude; and in his\nprivate dealings with his subjects let him show that his judgments are\nirrevocable, and maintain himself in such reputation that no one can\nhope either to deceive him or to get round him.\n\nThat prince is highly esteemed who conveys this impression of himself,\nand he who is highly esteemed is not easily conspired against; for,\nprovided it is well known that he is an excellent man and revered by\nhis people, he can only be attacked with difficulty. For this reason\na prince ought to have two fears, one from within, on account of his\nsubjects, the other from without, on account of external powers. From\nthe latter he is defended by being well armed and having good allies,\nand if he is well armed he will have good friends, and affairs will\nalways remain quiet within when they are quiet without, unless they\nshould have been already disturbed by conspiracy; and even should\naffairs outside be disturbed, if he has carried out his preparations and\nhas lived as I have said, as long as he does not despair, he will resist\nevery attack, as I said Nabis the Spartan did.\n\nBut concerning his subjects, when affairs outside are disturbed he has\nonly to fear that they will conspire secretly, from which a prince\ncan easily secure himself by avoiding being hated and despised, and by\nkeeping the people satisfied with him, which it is most necessary\nfor him to accomplish, as I said above at length. And one of the most\nefficacious remedies that a prince can have against conspiracies is not\nto be hated and despised by the people, for he who conspires against\na prince always expects to please them by his removal; but when the\nconspirator can only look forward to offending them, he will not have\nthe courage to take such a course, for the difficulties that confront\na conspirator are infinite. And as experience shows, many have been the\nconspiracies, but few have been successful; because he who conspires\ncannot act alone, nor can he take a companion except from those whom he\nbelieves to be malcontents, and as soon as you have opened your mind\nto a malcontent you have given him the material with which to content\nhimself, for by denouncing you he can look for every advantage; so that,\nseeing the gain from this course to be assured, and seeing the other\nto be doubtful and full of dangers, he must be a very rare friend, or a\nthoroughly obstinate enemy of the prince, to keep faith with you.\n\nAnd, to reduce the matter into a small compass, I say that, on the side\nof the conspirator, there is nothing but fear, jealousy, prospect of\npunishment to terrify him; but on the side of the prince there is the\nmajesty of the principality, the laws, the protection of friends and\nthe state to defend him; so that, adding to all these things the\npopular goodwill, it is impossible that any one should be so rash as to\nconspire. For whereas in general the conspirator has to fear before the\nexecution of his plot, in this case he has also to fear the sequel to\nthe crime; because on account of it he has the people for an enemy, and\nthus cannot hope for any escape.\n\nEndless examples could be given on this subject, but I will be content\nwith one, brought to pass within the memory of our fathers. Messer\nAnnibale Bentivogli, who was prince in Bologna (grandfather of the\npresent Annibale), having been murdered by the Canneschi, who had\nconspired against him, not one of his family survived but Messer\nGiovanni,(*) who was in childhood: immediately after his assassination\nthe people rose and murdered all the Canneschi. This sprung from the\npopular goodwill which the house of Bentivogli enjoyed in those days in\nBologna; which was so great that, although none remained there after the\ndeath of Annibale who was able to rule the state, the Bolognese, having\ninformation that there was one of the Bentivogli family in Florence,\nwho up to that time had been considered the son of a blacksmith, sent to\nFlorence for him and gave him the government of their city, and it was\nruled by him until Messer Giovanni came in due course to the government.\n\n     (*) Giovanni Bentivogli, born in Bologna 1438, died at Milan\n     1508. He ruled Bologna from 1462 to 1506. Machiavelli's\n     strong condemnation of conspiracies may get its edge from\n     his own very recent experience (February 1513), when he had\n     been arrested and tortured for his alleged complicity in the\n     Boscoli conspiracy.\n\nFor this reason I consider that a prince ought to reckon conspiracies\nof little account when his people hold him in esteem; but when it\nis hostile to him, and bears hatred towards him, he ought to fear\neverything and everybody. And well-ordered states and wise princes have\ntaken every care not to drive the nobles to desperation, and to keep the\npeople satisfied and contented, for this is one of the most important\nobjects a prince can have.\n\nAmong the best ordered and governed kingdoms of our times is France, and\nin it are found many good institutions on which depend the liberty\nand security of the king; of these the first is the parliament and its\nauthority, because he who founded the kingdom, knowing the ambition of\nthe nobility and their boldness, considered that a bit to their mouths\nwould be necessary to hold them in; and, on the other side, knowing the\nhatred of the people, founded in fear, against the nobles, he wished to\nprotect them, yet he was not anxious for this to be the particular care\nof the king; therefore, to take away the reproach which he would be\nliable to from the nobles for favouring the people, and from the people\nfor favouring the nobles, he set up an arbiter, who should be one who\ncould beat down the great and favour the lesser without reproach to the\nking. Neither could you have a better or a more prudent arrangement, or\na greater source of security to the king and kingdom. From this one can\ndraw another important conclusion, that princes ought to leave affairs\nof reproach to the management of others, and keep those of grace in\ntheir own hands. And further, I consider that a prince ought to cherish\nthe nobles, but not so as to make himself hated by the people.\n\nIt may appear, perhaps, to some who have examined the lives and deaths\nof the Roman emperors that many of them would be an example contrary\nto my opinion, seeing that some of them lived nobly and showed great\nqualities of soul, nevertheless they have lost their empire or have been\nkilled by subjects who have conspired against them. Wishing, therefore,\nto answer these objections, I will recall the characters of some of the\nemperors, and will show that the causes of their ruin were not different\nto those alleged by me; at the same time I will only submit for\nconsideration those things that are noteworthy to him who studies the\naffairs of those times.\n\nIt seems to me sufficient to take all those emperors who succeeded to\nthe empire from Marcus the philosopher down to Maximinus; they were\nMarcus and his son Commodus, Pertinax, Julian, Severus and his son\nAntoninus Caracalla, Macrinus, Heliogabalus, Alexander, and Maximinus.\n\nThere is first to note that, whereas in other principalities the\nambition of the nobles and the insolence of the people only have to be\ncontended with, the Roman emperors had a third difficulty in having to\nput up with the cruelty and avarice of their soldiers, a matter so beset\nwith difficulties that it was the ruin of many; for it was a hard thing\nto give satisfaction both to soldiers and people; because the people\nloved peace, and for this reason they loved the unaspiring prince,\nwhilst the soldiers loved the warlike prince who was bold, cruel, and\nrapacious, which qualities they were quite willing he should exercise\nupon the people, so that they could get double pay and give vent to\ntheir own greed and cruelty. Hence it arose that those emperors were\nalways overthrown who, either by birth or training, had no great\nauthority, and most of them, especially those who came new to the\nprincipality, recognizing the difficulty of these two opposing humours,\nwere inclined to give satisfaction to the soldiers, caring little about\ninjuring the people. Which course was necessary, because, as princes\ncannot help being hated by someone, they ought, in the first place, to\navoid being hated by every one, and when they cannot compass this, they\nought to endeavour with the utmost diligence to avoid the hatred of the\nmost powerful. Therefore, those emperors who through inexperience had\nneed of special favour adhered more readily to the soldiers than to\nthe people; a course which turned out advantageous to them or not,\naccordingly as the prince knew how to maintain authority over them.\n\nFrom these causes it arose that Marcus, Pertinax, and Alexander, being\nall men of modest life, lovers of justice, enemies to cruelty, humane,\nand benignant, came to a sad end except Marcus; he alone lived and died\nhonoured, because he had succeeded to the throne by hereditary title,\nand owed nothing either to the soldiers or the people; and afterwards,\nbeing possessed of many virtues which made him respected, he always kept\nboth orders in their places whilst he lived, and was neither hated nor\ndespised.\n\nBut Pertinax was created emperor against the wishes of the soldiers,\nwho, being accustomed to live licentiously under Commodus, could not\nendure the honest life to which Pertinax wished to reduce them; thus,\nhaving given cause for hatred, to which hatred there was added contempt\nfor his old age, he was overthrown at the very beginning of his\nadministration. And here it should be noted that hatred is acquired as\nmuch by good works as by bad ones, therefore, as I said before, a prince\nwishing to keep his state is very often forced to do evil; for when that\nbody is corrupt whom you think you have need of to maintain yourself--it\nmay be either the people or the soldiers or the nobles--you have to\nsubmit to its humours and to gratify them, and then good works will do\nyou harm.\n\nBut let us come to Alexander, who was a man of such great goodness,\nthat among the other praises which are accorded him is this, that in the\nfourteen years he held the empire no one was ever put to death by\nhim unjudged; nevertheless, being considered effeminate and a man who\nallowed himself to be governed by his mother, he became despised, the\narmy conspired against him, and murdered him.\n\nTurning now to the opposite characters of Commodus, Severus, Antoninus\nCaracalla, and Maximinus, you will find them all cruel and rapacious-men\nwho, to satisfy their soldiers, did not hesitate to commit every kind of\niniquity against the people; and all, except Severus, came to a bad\nend; but in Severus there was so much valour that, keeping the soldiers\nfriendly, although the people were oppressed by him, he reigned\nsuccessfully; for his valour made him so much admired in the sight of\nthe soldiers and people that the latter were kept in a way astonished\nand awed and the former respectful and satisfied. And because the\nactions of this man, as a new prince, were great, I wish to show\nbriefly that he knew well how to counterfeit the fox and the lion, which\nnatures, as I said above, it is necessary for a prince to imitate.\n\nKnowing the sloth of the Emperor Julian, he persuaded the army in\nSclavonia, of which he was captain, that it would be right to go to Rome\nand avenge the death of Pertinax, who had been killed by the praetorian\nsoldiers; and under this pretext, without appearing to aspire to the\nthrone, he moved the army on Rome, and reached Italy before it was known\nthat he had started. On his arrival at Rome, the Senate, through fear,\nelected him emperor and killed Julian. After this there remained for\nSeverus, who wished to make himself master of the whole empire, two\ndifficulties; one in Asia, where Niger, head of the Asiatic army, had\ncaused himself to be proclaimed emperor; the other in the west where\nAlbinus was, who also aspired to the throne. And as he considered it\ndangerous to declare himself hostile to both, he decided to attack\nNiger and to deceive Albinus. To the latter he wrote that, being elected\nemperor by the Senate, he was willing to share that dignity with him and\nsent him the title of Caesar; and, moreover, that the Senate had made\nAlbinus his colleague; which things were accepted by Albinus as true.\nBut after Severus had conquered and killed Niger, and settled oriental\naffairs, he returned to Rome and complained to the Senate that Albinus,\nlittle recognizing the benefits that he had received from him, had\nby treachery sought to murder him, and for this ingratitude he was\ncompelled to punish him. Afterwards he sought him out in France, and\ntook from him his government and life. He who will, therefore, carefully\nexamine the actions of this man will find him a most valiant lion and\na most cunning fox; he will find him feared and respected by every one,\nand not hated by the army; and it need not be wondered at that he, a\nnew man, was able to hold the empire so well, because his supreme\nrenown always protected him from that hatred which the people might have\nconceived against him for his violence.\n\nBut his son Antoninus was a most eminent man, and had very excellent\nqualities, which made him admirable in the sight of the people and\nacceptable to the soldiers, for he was a warlike man, most enduring\nof fatigue, a despiser of all delicate food and other luxuries, which\ncaused him to be beloved by the armies. Nevertheless, his ferocity and\ncruelties were so great and so unheard of that, after endless single\nmurders, he killed a large number of the people of Rome and all those of\nAlexandria. He became hated by the whole world, and also feared by those\nhe had around him, to such an extent that he was murdered in the midst\nof his army by a centurion. And here it must be noted that such-like\ndeaths, which are deliberately inflicted with a resolved and desperate\ncourage, cannot be avoided by princes, because any one who does not fear\nto die can inflict them; but a prince may fear them the less because\nthey are very rare; he has only to be careful not to do any grave injury\nto those whom he employs or has around him in the service of the state.\nAntoninus had not taken this care, but had contumeliously killed a\nbrother of that centurion, whom also he daily threatened, yet retained\nin his bodyguard; which, as it turned out, was a rash thing to do, and\nproved the emperor's ruin.\n\nBut let us come to Commodus, to whom it should have been very easy to\nhold the empire, for, being the son of Marcus, he had inherited it,\nand he had only to follow in the footsteps of his father to please his\npeople and soldiers; but, being by nature cruel and brutal, he gave\nhimself up to amusing the soldiers and corrupting them, so that he might\nindulge his rapacity upon the people; on the other hand, not maintaining\nhis dignity, often descending to the theatre to compete with gladiators,\nand doing other vile things, little worthy of the imperial majesty, he\nfell into contempt with the soldiers, and being hated by one party and\ndespised by the other, he was conspired against and was killed.\n\nIt remains to discuss the character of Maximinus. He was a very warlike\nman, and the armies, being disgusted with the effeminacy of Alexander,\nof whom I have already spoken, killed him and elected Maximinus to the\nthrone. This he did not possess for long, for two things made him hated\nand despised; the one, his having kept sheep in Thrace, which brought\nhim into contempt (it being well known to all, and considered a great\nindignity by every one), and the other, his having at the accession\nto his dominions deferred going to Rome and taking possession of the\nimperial seat; he had also gained a reputation for the utmost ferocity\nby having, through his prefects in Rome and elsewhere in the empire,\npractised many cruelties, so that the whole world was moved to anger\nat the meanness of his birth and to fear at his barbarity. First Africa\nrebelled, then the Senate with all the people of Rome, and all Italy\nconspired against him, to which may be added his own army; this latter,\nbesieging Aquileia and meeting with difficulties in taking it, were\ndisgusted with his cruelties, and fearing him less when they found so\nmany against him, murdered him.\n\nI do not wish to discuss Heliogabalus, Macrinus, or Julian, who, being\nthoroughly contemptible, were quickly wiped out; but I will bring this\ndiscourse to a conclusion by saying that princes in our times have this\ndifficulty of giving inordinate satisfaction to their soldiers in a\nfar less degree, because, notwithstanding one has to give them some\nindulgence, that is soon done; none of these princes have armies that\nare veterans in the governance and administration of provinces, as were\nthe armies of the Roman Empire; and whereas it was then more necessary\nto give satisfaction to the soldiers than to the people, it is now more\nnecessary to all princes, except the Turk and the Soldan, to satisfy the\npeople rather the soldiers, because the people are the more powerful.\n\nFrom the above I have excepted the Turk, who always keeps round him\ntwelve thousand infantry and fifteen thousand cavalry on which depend\nthe security and strength of the kingdom, and it is necessary that,\nputting aside every consideration for the people, he should keep them\nhis friends. The kingdom of the Soldan is similar; being entirely in the\nhands of soldiers, it follows again that, without regard to the people,\nhe must keep them his friends. But you must note that the state of the\nSoldan is unlike all other principalities, for the reason that it\nis like the Christian pontificate, which cannot be called either an\nhereditary or a newly formed principality; because the sons of the old\nprince are not the heirs, but he who is elected to that position by\nthose who have authority, and the sons remain only noblemen. And this\nbeing an ancient custom, it cannot be called a new principality, because\nthere are none of those difficulties in it that are met with in new\nones; for although the prince is new, the constitution of the state is\nold, and it is framed so as to receive him as if he were its hereditary\nlord.\n\nBut returning to the subject of our discourse, I say that whoever will\nconsider it will acknowledge that either hatred or contempt has been\nfatal to the above-named emperors, and it will be recognized also how\nit happened that, a number of them acting in one way and a number\nin another, only one in each way came to a happy end and the rest to\nunhappy ones. Because it would have been useless and dangerous for\nPertinax and Alexander, being new princes, to imitate Marcus, who\nwas heir to the principality; and likewise it would have been utterly\ndestructive to Caracalla, Commodus, and Maximinus to have imitated\nSeverus, they not having sufficient valour to enable them to tread\nin his footsteps. Therefore a prince, new to the principality, cannot\nimitate the actions of Marcus, nor, again, is it necessary to follow\nthose of Severus, but he ought to take from Severus those parts which\nare necessary to found his state, and from Marcus those which are proper\nand glorious to keep a state that may already be stable and firm.\n\n\n\n", "summary": "\"On Avoiding Contempt and Hatred,\" brings this line of reasoning full circle, noting off the bat that a prince should be sure not to be hated, for conspiracies fail if the prince is loved. A prince should delegate unpleasant jobs to others and keep the pleasant ones - the ones that look good - for himself. France's use of a third judicial force which was not the king's direct responsibility is an example of such a tactic", "metadata": {"bid": 1232, "is_aggregate": false, "source": "gradesaver", "chapter_path": "all_chapterized_books/1232-chapters/19.txt", "summary_path": "finished_summaries/gradesaver/The Prince/section_5_part_4.txt", "book_id": "The Prince.chapter xix", "summary_id": "chapter xix", "chapter_length": 3308, "summary_name": "Chapter XIX", "summary_url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20210417004655/https://www.gradesaver.com/the-prince/study-guide/summary-section-6-chapters-xv-xix", "summary_analysis": "If The Prince is often characterized as a treatise on unscrupulous politics and a manual of ruthless power games, Chapter XV, \"On the Reasons Why Men Are Praised or Blamed - Especially Princes,\" is a particularly crucial chapter. It is here that Machiavelli directly addresses the question that has been bubbling underneath the surface of his book thus far - namely, to what extent does being good matter? Machiavelli's answer: as long as it contributes to holding onto power. The key notion here is that good is a relative concept; surface virtuosity, of the kind often showcased by rulers, is often but a disguise, and the greatest good lies in the end - the all-inclusive goal of maintaining the state and securing the reins of power. In other words, good is good insofar as it is politically expedient. The categorical crumbles in the face of efficiency, for the latter is the only true barometer. The ends justify the means, and utilitarianism  is the dominant mode of reasoning. If a prince needs to indulge a vice to save his state, so be it. \"For if you look at matters carefully,\" Machiavelli writes, \"you will see that something resembling virtue, if you follow it, may be your ruin, while something resembling vice will lead, if you follow it, to your security and well-being.\" One might compare this argument to the thrust of Chapter XIII, \"On Those Who Have Become Princes By Crime,\" which measures when and to what extent a prince's cruelty can be justified. Machiavelli is arguing something far more complex than a call to disregard morality. His example of the generous prince begins as a seemingly hard-lined argument and emerges as a humanist consideration of the faults of man. A prince should not be miserly just for the sake of it; miserliness, by resulting in the safeguarding of funds and greater financial security, winds up helping the people in quite direct ways. It is up to the prince to see beyond short-run desires and superficial appearances and to not give away money he cannot afford to spend just to put on a lovable face and to curry favor, but instead to weather the occasional criticism and plan for the future. It is all about the greater good. Machiavelli sublimates the individualistic treatment of the prince as solitary agent into a larger view of society as contingent on long-term planning and sacrifice. The Prince reads here as less a how-to for the aspiring prince than a social manifesto; Machiavelli puts faith in the people's judgment, arguing that they will come around to loving the miserly prince who saves money out of necessity. As in his earlier distinctions between the common people and the nobles, he emerges as more of a populist and democrat than popular conceptions of The Prince tend to allow for. That said, Chapter XVII, \"On Cruelty and Clemency,\" presents a thoroughly pessimistic view of humanity. Men are inherently \"rotten,\" Machiavelli argues, explaining that they are \"ungrateful, fickle, liars and deceivers, fearful of danger and greedy for gain.\" For this reason, it is safer for a prince to be feared than to be loved: \"love is link of obligation which men, because they are rotten, will break any time they think doing so serves their advantage.\" Fear, on the other hand, \"involves dread of punishment, from which they can never escape.\" As always, Machiavelli tempers what seems at first like a thoroughly cynical position, noting that moderation is the key, and that a prince should try to make himself feared in a way that does not make him hated. More specifically, he should only shed blood when he has good reason to, he should not confiscate property, and he should keep his hands off his subjects' women. Certain lines cannot be crossed. As Machiavelli writes a few pages later, a prince \"should be ready to enter on evil if he has to,\" but he must have to.  In any case, virtues are often difficult to define; they are only virtuous insofar as they help people. Virtue for its own sake can be harmful, and for a prince to possess and exercise all virtues at all times is a mistake. Appearances are a different matter: the masses are impressed by the superficial appearance of things so long as the prince's ends are achieved. It matters little, therefore, who the prince really is. Machiavelli closes Chapter XVIII with a reference that deserves mention. \"A certain prince of our own time,\" he writes, \"whom it's just as well not to name, preaches nothing but peace and mutual trust, yet he is the determined enemy of both.\" This seems to be a condemnation, but Machiavelli continues: \"if on several different occasions he had observed either, he would have lost both his reputation and his throne.\" The prince in question is Ferdinand of Spain, and the passage is something of a swipe at him. The first line suggests untempered scorn, while the second modifies this position and recasts Ferdinand as an example of how hypocrisy can be useful. These last few words are perhaps the veil Machiavelli uses to hide a more acute criticism of Ferdinand, who secured his power through often bloodthirsty tactics, expelling the Muslims and Jews from Spain, waging war, and persecuting the masses. These repellent maneuvers, Machiavelli is forced to admit, did work. We can sense here the writer having reached a sort of theoretical impasse: how to both condemn and praise? How to reconcile a need for human goodness  with the demands of power and the vicissitudes of international relations? Ferdinand provides a particularly difficult case, since Machiavelli, writing of him as a \"determined enemy\" of peace and trust, seems to disapprove of him, while his own writings provide a framework whereby Ferdinand's actions are thoroughly justifiable. What is perhaps most important is that Machiavelli faces Ferdinand head-on. Contradictions may abound as Machiavelli maps out his philosophy, but he seems to implicitly acknowledge this. The Prince is more than a simplistic argument for cold-heartedness in politics, and these chapters reflect Machiavelli's efforts to grapple with the various problems his more cynical positions engender.", "summary_length": 77, "analysis_length": 1027}, "system_sum": ":\n\nAvoid rapacity and being a violator of your subjects' property, and be an excellent man to make yourself respected. :\n\n- Taking all Roman emperors from Marcus the philosopher to Maximinus, it is clear that there was great variability in how well they managed to keep the empire.\n- Some, like Marcus and Pertinax, were able to keep the soldiers and people happy with their relative pacifism and justice-oriented policies; others, like Commodus, Severus, and Antoninus Caracalla, were unable to do so, and ended up being overthrown. : New rulers should take from their predecessors what is necessary to help them establish their rule and then adapt themselves to the times.", "eval_score": {"rouge-1": {"r": 0.22807017543859648, "p": 0.15476190476190477, "f": 0.18439715830390838}, "rouge-2": {"r": 0.013333333333333334, "p": 0.009174311926605505, "f": 0.010869560388116511}, "rouge-l": {"r": 0.19298245614035087, "p": 0.13095238095238096, "f": 0.15602836397766726}, "bleu-1": 0.2047244094488189, "bleu-2": 0.15748031496062992}}

{"text": "\nBut the difficulties occur in a new principality. And firstly, if it be\nnot entirely new, but is, as it were, a member of a state which, taken\ncollectively, may be called composite, the changes arise chiefly from\nan inherent difficulty which there is in all new principalities; for\nmen change their rulers willingly, hoping to better themselves, and this\nhope induces them to take up arms against him who rules: wherein they\nare deceived, because they afterwards find by experience they have\ngone from bad to worse. This follows also on another natural and common\nnecessity, which always causes a new prince to burden those who have\nsubmitted to him with his soldiery and with infinite other hardships\nwhich he must put upon his new acquisition.\n\nIn this way you have enemies in all those whom you have injured in\nseizing that principality, and you are not able to keep those friends\nwho put you there because of your not being able to satisfy them in the\nway they expected, and you cannot take strong measures against them,\nfeeling bound to them. For, although one may be very strong in armed\nforces, yet in entering a province one has always need of the goodwill\nof the natives.\n\nFor these reasons Louis the Twelfth, King of France, quickly occupied\nMilan, and as quickly lost it; and to turn him out the first time it\nonly needed Lodovico's own forces; because those who had opened the\ngates to him, finding themselves deceived in their hopes of future\nbenefit, would not endure the ill-treatment of the new prince. It is\nvery true that, after acquiring rebellious provinces a second time,\nthey are not so lightly lost afterwards, because the prince, with\nlittle reluctance, takes the opportunity of the rebellion to punish the\ndelinquents, to clear out the suspects, and to strengthen himself in the\nweakest places. Thus to cause France to lose Milan the first time it was\nenough for the Duke Lodovico(*) to raise insurrections on the borders;\nbut to cause him to lose it a second time it was necessary to bring\nthe whole world against him, and that his armies should be defeated and\ndriven out of Italy; which followed from the causes above mentioned.\n\n     (*) Duke Lodovico was Lodovico Moro, a son of Francesco\n     Sforza, who married Beatrice d'Este. He ruled over Milan\n     from 1494 to 1500, and died in 1510.\n\nNevertheless Milan was taken from France both the first and the second\ntime. The general reasons for the first have been discussed; it remains\nto name those for the second, and to see what resources he had, and what\nany one in his situation would have had for maintaining himself more\nsecurely in his acquisition than did the King of France.\n\nNow I say that those dominions which, when acquired, are added to an\nancient state by him who acquires them, are either of the same country\nand language, or they are not. When they are, it is easier to hold them,\nespecially when they have not been accustomed to self-government; and\nto hold them securely it is enough to have destroyed the family of the\nprince who was ruling them; because the two peoples, preserving in other\nthings the old conditions, and not being unlike in customs, will live\nquietly together, as one has seen in Brittany, Burgundy, Gascony, and\nNormandy, which have been bound to France for so long a time: and,\nalthough there may be some difference in language, nevertheless the\ncustoms are alike, and the people will easily be able to get on amongst\nthemselves. He who has annexed them, if he wishes to hold them, has only\nto bear in mind two considerations: the one, that the family of their\nformer lord is extinguished; the other, that neither their laws nor\ntheir taxes are altered, so that in a very short time they will become\nentirely one body with the old principality.\n\nBut when states are acquired in a country differing in language,\ncustoms, or laws, there are difficulties, and good fortune and great\nenergy are needed to hold them, and one of the greatest and most real\nhelps would be that he who has acquired them should go and reside there.\nThis would make his position more secure and durable, as it has made\nthat of the Turk in Greece, who, notwithstanding all the other measures\ntaken by him for holding that state, if he had not settled there, would\nnot have been able to keep it. Because, if one is on the spot, disorders\nare seen as they spring up, and one can quickly remedy them; but if one\nis not at hand, they are heard of only when they are great, and then one\ncan no longer remedy them. Besides this, the country is not pillaged\nby your officials; the subjects are satisfied by prompt recourse to the\nprince; thus, wishing to be good, they have more cause to love him, and\nwishing to be otherwise, to fear him. He who would attack that state\nfrom the outside must have the utmost caution; as long as the prince\nresides there it can only be wrested from him with the greatest\ndifficulty.\n\nThe other and better course is to send colonies to one or two places,\nwhich may be as keys to that state, for it is necessary either to do\nthis or else to keep there a great number of cavalry and infantry. A\nprince does not spend much on colonies, for with little or no expense he\ncan send them out and keep them there, and he offends a minority only of\nthe citizens from whom he takes lands and houses to give them to the new\ninhabitants; and those whom he offends, remaining poor and scattered,\nare never able to injure him; whilst the rest being uninjured are easily\nkept quiet, and at the same time are anxious not to err for fear it\nshould happen to them as it has to those who have been despoiled. In\nconclusion, I say that these colonies are not costly, they are more\nfaithful, they injure less, and the injured, as has been said, being\npoor and scattered, cannot hurt. Upon this, one has to remark that men\nought either to be well treated or crushed, because they can avenge\nthemselves of lighter injuries, of more serious ones they cannot;\ntherefore the injury that is to be done to a man ought to be of such a\nkind that one does not stand in fear of revenge.\n\nBut in maintaining armed men there in place of colonies one spends much\nmore, having to consume on the garrison all the income from the\nstate, so that the acquisition turns into a loss, and many more are\nexasperated, because the whole state is injured; through the shifting\nof the garrison up and down all become acquainted with hardship, and\nall become hostile, and they are enemies who, whilst beaten on their\nown ground, are yet able to do hurt. For every reason, therefore, such\nguards are as useless as a colony is useful.\n\nAgain, the prince who holds a country differing in the above respects\nought to make himself the head and defender of his less powerful\nneighbours, and to weaken the more powerful amongst them, taking care\nthat no foreigner as powerful as himself shall, by any accident, get\na footing there; for it will always happen that such a one will be\nintroduced by those who are discontented, either through excess of\nambition or through fear, as one has seen already. The Romans were\nbrought into Greece by the Aetolians; and in every other country where\nthey obtained a footing they were brought in by the inhabitants. And the\nusual course of affairs is that, as soon as a powerful foreigner enters\na country, all the subject states are drawn to him, moved by the hatred\nwhich they feel against the ruling power. So that in respect to those\nsubject states he has not to take any trouble to gain them over to\nhimself, for the whole of them quickly rally to the state which he has\nacquired there. He has only to take care that they do not get hold of\ntoo much power and too much authority, and then with his own forces, and\nwith their goodwill, he can easily keep down the more powerful of them,\nso as to remain entirely master in the country. And he who does not\nproperly manage this business will soon lose what he has acquired, and\nwhilst he does hold it he will have endless difficulties and troubles.\n\nThe Romans, in the countries which they annexed, observed closely these\nmeasures; they sent colonies and maintained friendly relations with(*)\nthe minor powers, without increasing their strength; they kept down the\ngreater, and did not allow any strong foreign powers to gain authority.\nGreece appears to me sufficient for an example. The Achaeans and\nAetolians were kept friendly by them, the kingdom of Macedonia was\nhumbled, Antiochus was driven out; yet the merits of the Achaeans and\nAetolians never secured for them permission to increase their power, nor\ndid the persuasions of Philip ever induce the Romans to be his friends\nwithout first humbling him, nor did the influence of Antiochus make them\nagree that he should retain any lordship over the country. Because the\nRomans did in these instances what all prudent princes ought to do,\nwho have to regard not only present troubles, but also future ones, for\nwhich they must prepare with every energy, because, when foreseen, it is\neasy to remedy them; but if you wait until they approach, the medicine\nis no longer in time because the malady has become incurable; for it\nhappens in this, as the physicians say it happens in hectic fever,\nthat in the beginning of the malady it is easy to cure but difficult to\ndetect, but in the course of time, not having been either detected or\ntreated in the beginning, it becomes easy to detect but difficult to\ncure. Thus it happens in affairs of state, for when the evils that arise\nhave been foreseen (which it is only given to a wise man to see), they\ncan be quickly redressed, but when, through not having been foreseen,\nthey have been permitted to grow in a way that every one can see them,\nthere is no longer a remedy. Therefore, the Romans, foreseeing troubles,\ndealt with them at once, and, even to avoid a war, would not let them\ncome to a head, for they knew that war is not to be avoided, but is only\nto be put off to the advantage of others; moreover they wished to fight\nwith Philip and Antiochus in Greece so as not to have to do it in Italy;\nthey could have avoided both, but this they did not wish; nor did that\never please them which is forever in the mouths of the wise ones of our\ntime:--Let us enjoy the benefits of the time--but rather the benefits of\ntheir own valour and prudence, for time drives everything before it, and\nis able to bring with it good as well as evil, and evil as well as good.\n\n     (*) See remark in the introduction on the word\n     \"intrattenere.\"\n\nBut let us turn to France and inquire whether she has done any of the\nthings mentioned. I will speak of Louis(*) (and not of Charles)(+) as\nthe one whose conduct is the better to be observed, he having held\npossession of Italy for the longest period; and you will see that he\nhas done the opposite to those things which ought to be done to retain a\nstate composed of divers elements.\n\n     (*) Louis XII, King of France, \"The Father of the People,\"\n     born 1462, died 1515.\n\n     (+) Charles VIII, King of France, born 1470, died 1498.\n\nKing Louis was brought into Italy by the ambition of the Venetians, who\ndesired to obtain half the state of Lombardy by his intervention. I\nwill not blame the course taken by the king, because, wishing to get a\nfoothold in Italy, and having no friends there--seeing rather that every\ndoor was shut to him owing to the conduct of Charles--he was forced to\naccept those friendships which he could get, and he would have succeeded\nvery quickly in his design if in other matters he had not made some\nmistakes. The king, however, having acquired Lombardy, regained at once\nthe authority which Charles had lost: Genoa yielded; the Florentines\nbecame his friends; the Marquess of Mantua, the Duke of Ferrara, the\nBentivogli, my lady of Forli, the Lords of Faenza, of Pesaro, of\nRimini, of Camerino, of Piombino, the Lucchese, the Pisans, the\nSienese--everybody made advances to him to become his friend. Then could\nthe Venetians realize the rashness of the course taken by them, which,\nin order that they might secure two towns in Lombardy, had made the king\nmaster of two-thirds of Italy.\n\nLet any one now consider with what little difficulty the king could have\nmaintained his position in Italy had he observed the rules above laid\ndown, and kept all his friends secure and protected; for although they\nwere numerous they were both weak and timid, some afraid of the Church,\nsome of the Venetians, and thus they would always have been forced to\nstand in with him, and by their means he could easily have made himself\nsecure against those who remained powerful. But he was no sooner in\nMilan than he did the contrary by assisting Pope Alexander to occupy the\nRomagna. It never occurred to him that by this action he was weakening\nhimself, depriving himself of friends and of those who had thrown\nthemselves into his lap, whilst he aggrandized the Church by adding much\ntemporal power to the spiritual, thus giving it greater authority. And\nhaving committed this prime error, he was obliged to follow it up, so\nmuch so that, to put an end to the ambition of Alexander, and to prevent\nhis becoming the master of Tuscany, he was himself forced to come into\nItaly.\n\nAnd as if it were not enough to have aggrandized the Church, and\ndeprived himself of friends, he, wishing to have the kingdom of Naples,\ndivided it with the King of Spain, and where he was the prime arbiter in\nItaly he takes an associate, so that the ambitious of that country and\nthe malcontents of his own should have somewhere to shelter; and whereas\nhe could have left in the kingdom his own pensioner as king, he drove\nhim out, to put one there who was able to drive him, Louis, out in turn.\n\nThe wish to acquire is in truth very natural and common, and men always\ndo so when they can, and for this they will be praised not blamed; but\nwhen they cannot do so, yet wish to do so by any means, then there is\nfolly and blame. Therefore, if France could have attacked Naples with\nher own forces she ought to have done so; if she could not, then she\nought not to have divided it. And if the partition which she made with\nthe Venetians in Lombardy was justified by the excuse that by it she got\na foothold in Italy, this other partition merited blame, for it had not\nthe excuse of that necessity.\n\nTherefore Louis made these five errors: he destroyed the minor powers,\nhe increased the strength of one of the greater powers in Italy, he\nbrought in a foreign power, he did not settle in the country, he did not\nsend colonies. Which errors, had he lived, were not enough to injure\nhim had he not made a sixth by taking away their dominions from the\nVenetians; because, had he not aggrandized the Church, nor brought Spain\ninto Italy, it would have been very reasonable and necessary to humble\nthem; but having first taken these steps, he ought never to have\nconsented to their ruin, for they, being powerful, would always have\nkept off others from designs on Lombardy, to which the Venetians would\nnever have consented except to become masters themselves there; also\nbecause the others would not wish to take Lombardy from France in order\nto give it to the Venetians, and to run counter to both they would not\nhave had the courage.\n\nAnd if any one should say: \"King Louis yielded the Romagna to Alexander\nand the kingdom to Spain to avoid war,\" I answer for the reasons given\nabove that a blunder ought never to be perpetrated to avoid war, because\nit is not to be avoided, but is only deferred to your disadvantage. And\nif another should allege the pledge which the king had given to the\nPope that he would assist him in the enterprise, in exchange for the\ndissolution of his marriage(*) and for the cap to Rouen,(+) to that I\nreply what I shall write later on concerning the faith of princes, and\nhow it ought to be kept.\n\n     (*) Louis XII divorced his wife, Jeanne, daughter of Louis\n     XI, and married in 1499 Anne of Brittany, widow of Charles\n     VIII, in order to retain the Duchy of Brittany for the\n     crown.\n\n     (+) The Archbishop of Rouen. He was Georges d'Amboise,\n     created a cardinal by Alexander VI. Born 1460, died 1510.\n\nThus King Louis lost Lombardy by not having followed any of the\nconditions observed by those who have taken possession of countries and\nwished to retain them. Nor is there any miracle in this, but much that\nis reasonable and quite natural. And on these matters I spoke at Nantes\nwith Rouen, when Valentino, as Cesare Borgia, the son of Pope Alexander,\nwas usually called, occupied the Romagna, and on Cardinal Rouen\nobserving to me that the Italians did not understand war, I replied\nto him that the French did not understand statecraft, meaning that\notherwise they would not have allowed the Church to reach such\ngreatness. And in fact it has been seen that the greatness of the Church\nand of Spain in Italy has been caused by France, and her ruin may be\nattributed to them. From this a general rule is drawn which never or\nrarely fails: that he who is the cause of another becoming powerful\nis ruined; because that predominancy has been brought about either by\nastuteness or else by force, and both are distrusted by him who has been\nraised to power.\n\n\n\n", "summary": "New monarchies are hard to deal with, even the sort of new ones that are just adding a territory onto an old monarchy. Machiavelli calls these mixed monarchies. What's the problem? The conquered will rebel at the first sign of a better situation, which is good if you want to take over but bad once you've conquered them. As elected officials find out, you can never give people all the things they expected, so they'll hate you for a while. Here's the thing: you need them to not hate you because your army can't control the new land by themselves and need the people on their side. Machiavelli gives the example of when the king of France, Louis XII, tried to take Milan. Everyone thought that Louis was going to be this awesome king, so they helped him kick out their ruler, Duke Ludovico. The thing is, Louis XII was awful, so they ran back to Ludovico. Even though it was easy to take over Milan the first time, after that, the Milanese wised up and it took \"the whole world\" to push their way in the second time . But then Louis was kicked out again. Why did he lose the second time? Let's take a look: If the land you are adding to your kingdom shares the same language as the rest of the kingdom, great. All you have to do is kill the old rulers and you're set. Leave everything else alone. Seriously. It'll all work out. Do that and you're golden. \"But what if my new territory speaks a different language,\" we hear you bloodthirsty princes and princesses asking. That's just a wee bit more difficult. In that case, you should go live there. You wanted a new summer home didn't you? Then, if anyone tries to rebel, you can shut them down personally. Also, then you don't have to trust that officials are taking care of your new pet country instead of stealing all of its riches. Plus, people are more likely to like you if they see you as one of them, and most people would think twice about attacking your new crib. Basically, this is the best way to go. Don't want to move? Then you can make colonies instead. This is great because it doesn't require lots of military and it's super cheap. Just take land from the natives and give it to your colonialists. The only downside is that the people whose land you took will be angry. But that doesn't matter because they are poor and have no land. Win-win. By the way, you should only deal with people in two ways: crush them or pamper them to death. If you are going to hit, you need to hit so hard that they can't stand up again. Are you thinking about armies? Stop it. Armies will cause widespread but uneven damage, leaving more than enough people left who can hit back and are looking for you. Bad idea. Okay, next thing you have to do is become the guardian angel for the weaker nations around your new land. Or at least look like it. What you are really doing is making sure a strong foreign power doesn't swoop in and start cramping your style. People have this silly tendency to ask foreign nations to come in and save them from their horrible rulers. That's how the Roman Empire got so huge--people invited them in. You want to make sure that no foreigners come in and that everyone is on your side. So play nice with the neighbors. Machiavelli has the perfect example: the Romans. They had colonies, they made friends with the neighbors, they made strong neighbors weaker, and they didn't let any stronger people move into the neighborhood. Perfect. They were preparing for trouble that might come in the future, which is the easiest and best way to deal with problems. They didn't try to procrastinate, which only makes things worse. They hit their problems head on. Anyway, back to Louis and Milan. Why was he so terrible again? Oh yeah, he did the opposite of everything he was supposed to do. He didn't play nice with his neighbors and he actually helped two stronger powers move in to the neighborhood. He helped Pope Alexander invade Romagna and basically carried the King of Spain's moving boxes into Naples so they could split the Kingdom and be roomies. Yikes, no wonder he got kicked out. Machiavelli gets that Louis wanted more land, but it's best not to get too greedy. It doesn't make sense to get more land if you can't do it on your own. Help comes with too many strings attached. So in total, Louis was stupid in six ways:He got rid of his weaker buddies. He made the pope stronger.He brought a stronger king into his neighborhood.He didn't live in his new land.He didn't establish colonies. And the worst offense: he took power away from Venice, which allowed another strong state to muscle its way in. He got rid of his weaker buddies. He made the pope stronger. He brought a stronger king into his neighborhood. He didn't live in his new land. He didn't establish colonies. And the worst offense: he took power away from Venice, which allowed another strong state to muscle its way in. According to Machiavelli, it's no surprise that he lost his land. He did everything wrong, after all.", "metadata": {"bid": 1232, "is_aggregate": false, "source": "shmoop", "chapter_path": "all_chapterized_books/1232-chapters/03.txt", "summary_path": "finished_summaries/shmoop/The Prince/section_3_part_0.txt", "book_id": "The Prince.chapter 3", "summary_id": "chapter 3", "chapter_length": 2914, "summary_name": "Chapter 3", "summary_url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20210420060055/https://www.shmoop.com/study-guides/literature/prince-machiavelli/summary/chapter-3", "summary_analysis": NaN, "summary_length": 907, "analysis_length": 1}, "system_sum": ": New principalities are difficult to govern, as the people who live there change their rulers quickly and hope for better things.

{"text": "Considering the difficulties which men have had to hold to a newly\nacquired state, some might wonder how, seeing that Alexander the\nGreat became the master of Asia in a few years, and died whilst it\nwas scarcely settled (whence it might appear reasonable that the whole\nempire would have rebelled), nevertheless his successors maintained\nthemselves, and had to meet no other difficulty than that which arose\namong themselves from their own ambitions.\n\nI answer that the principalities of which one has record are found to\nbe governed in two different ways; either by a prince, with a body\nof servants, who assist him to govern the kingdom as ministers by his\nfavour and permission; or by a prince and barons, who hold that dignity\nby antiquity of blood and not by the grace of the prince. Such barons\nhave states and their own subjects, who recognize them as lords and hold\nthem in natural affection. Those states that are governed by a prince\nand his servants hold their prince in more consideration, because in all\nthe country there is no one who is recognized as superior to him, and\nif they yield obedience to another they do it as to a minister and\nofficial, and they do not bear him any particular affection.\n\nThe examples of these two governments in our time are the Turk and the\nKing of France. The entire monarchy of the Turk is governed by one lord,\nthe others are his servants; and, dividing his kingdom into sanjaks, he\nsends there different administrators, and shifts and changes them as\nhe chooses. But the King of France is placed in the midst of an ancient\nbody of lords, acknowledged by their own subjects, and beloved by them;\nthey have their own prerogatives, nor can the king take these away\nexcept at his peril. Therefore, he who considers both of these states\nwill recognize great difficulties in seizing the state of the Turk,\nbut, once it is conquered, great ease in holding it. The causes of the\ndifficulties in seizing the kingdom of the Turk are that the usurper\ncannot be called in by the princes of the kingdom, nor can he hope to be\nassisted in his designs by the revolt of those whom the lord has around\nhim. This arises from the reasons given above; for his ministers, being\nall slaves and bondmen, can only be corrupted with great difficulty, and\none can expect little advantage from them when they have been corrupted,\nas they cannot carry the people with them, for the reasons assigned.\nHence, he who attacks the Turk must bear in mind that he will find him\nunited, and he will have to rely more on his own strength than on the\nrevolt of others; but, if once the Turk has been conquered, and routed\nin the field in such a way that he cannot replace his armies, there\nis nothing to fear but the family of this prince, and, this being\nexterminated, there remains no one to fear, the others having no credit\nwith the people; and as the conqueror did not rely on them before his\nvictory, so he ought not to fear them after it.\n\nThe contrary happens in kingdoms governed like that of France, because\none can easily enter there by gaining over some baron of the kingdom,\nfor one always finds malcontents and such as desire a change. Such men,\nfor the reasons given, can open the way into the state and render the\nvictory easy; but if you wish to hold it afterwards, you meet with\ninfinite difficulties, both from those who have assisted you and from\nthose you have crushed. Nor is it enough for you to have exterminated\nthe family of the prince, because the lords that remain make themselves\nthe heads of fresh movements against you, and as you are unable either\nto satisfy or exterminate them, that state is lost whenever time brings\nthe opportunity.\n\nNow if you will consider what was the nature of the government of\nDarius, you will find it similar to the kingdom of the Turk, and\ntherefore it was only necessary for Alexander, first to overthrow him in\nthe field, and then to take the country from him. After which victory,\nDarius being killed, the state remained secure to Alexander, for the\nabove reasons. And if his successors had been united they would have\nenjoyed it securely and at their ease, for there were no tumults raised\nin the kingdom except those they provoked themselves.\n\nBut it is impossible to hold with such tranquillity states constituted\nlike that of France. Hence arose those frequent rebellions against the\nRomans in Spain, France, and Greece, owing to the many principalities\nthere were in these states, of which, as long as the memory of them\nendured, the Romans always held an insecure possession; but with the\npower and long continuance of the empire the memory of them passed\naway, and the Romans then became secure possessors. And when fighting\nafterwards amongst themselves, each one was able to attach to himself\nhis own parts of the country, according to the authority he had assumed\nthere; and the family of the former lord being exterminated, none other\nthan the Romans were acknowledged.\n\nWhen these things are remembered no one will marvel at the ease with\nwhich Alexander held the Empire of Asia, or at the difficulties which\nothers have had to keep an acquisition, such as Pyrrhus and many more;\nthis is not occasioned by the little or abundance of ability in the\nconqueror, but by the want of uniformity in the subject state.\n\n\n\n", "summary": "Now you're thinking: didn't Alexander the Great get land quickly and hold on to it even after his death? And weren't you just saying how difficult it is to hold on to new lands, Machiavelli? Well, there's a perfectly reasonable explanation for that. There are two ways to govern a monarchy: by a king and non-elected barons or by a king and his appointed ministers. In the second one, the king is more powerful since he's the only person who has real power. Turkey is one example of this kind of government. Because the king has all the power, a country like Turkey is pretty hard to conquer. There are no barons to help you by turning against the king. But on the plus side, once you do take over, ruling is a piece of cake because there are no barons to try to challenge you. On the other hand, we have places like France, where there's a king and barons that go back a long time. It's super easy to get into one of these places, since a baron somewhere is probably pissed at the king and wants him gone. The problem is, those same barons can turn against you after the old king is gone, so it's hard to hold on to these sorts of kingdoms. Back to Alexander. Why was it easy to keep his lands?
