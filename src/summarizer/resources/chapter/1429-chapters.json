{"chapters": [{"id": 1, "text": "<CHAPTER>\n1. AT THE BAY. Chapter 1.I.\n\nVery early morning. The sun was not yet risen, and the whole of Crescent\nBay was hidden under a white sea-mist. The big bush-covered hills at the\nback were smothered. You could not see where they ended and the paddocks\nand bungalows began. The sandy road was gone and the paddocks and\nbungalows the other side of it; there were no white dunes covered with\nreddish grass beyond them; there was nothing to mark which was beach and\nwhere was the sea. A heavy dew had fallen. The grass was blue. Big drops\nhung on the bushes and just did not fall; the silvery, fluffy toi-toi\nwas limp on its long stalks, and all the marigolds and the pinks in the\nbungalow gardens were bowed to the earth with wetness. Drenched were the\ncold fuchsias, round pearls of dew lay on the flat nasturtium leaves. It\nlooked as though the sea had beaten up softly in the darkness, as though\none immense wave had come rippling, rippling--how far? Perhaps if you\nhad waked up in the middle of the night you might have seen a big fish\nflicking in at the window and gone again....\n\nAh-Aah! sounded the sleepy sea. And from the bush there came the sound\nof little streams flowing, quickly, lightly, slipping between the smooth\nstones, gushing into ferny basins and out again; and there was the\nsplashing of big drops on large leaves, and something else--what was\nit?--a faint stirring and shaking, the snapping of a twig and then such\nsilence that it seemed some one was listening.\n\nRound the corner of Crescent Bay, between the piled-up masses of broken\nrock, a flock of sheep came pattering. They were huddled together, a\nsmall, tossing, woolly mass, and their thin, stick-like legs trotted\nalong quickly as if the cold and the quiet had frightened them. Behind\nthem an old sheep-dog, his soaking paws covered with sand, ran along\nwith his nose to the ground, but carelessly, as if thinking of something\nelse. And then in the rocky gateway the shepherd himself appeared. He\nwas a lean, upright old man, in a frieze coat that was covered with a\nweb of tiny drops, velvet trousers tied under the knee, and a wide-awake\nwith a folded blue handkerchief round the brim. One hand was crammed\ninto his belt, the other grasped a beautifully smooth yellow stick. And\nas he walked, taking his time, he kept up a very soft light whistling,\nan airy, far-away fluting that sounded mournful and tender. The old\ndog cut an ancient caper or two and then drew up sharp, ashamed of his\nlevity, and walked a few dignified paces by his master's side. The sheep\nran forward in little pattering rushes; they began to bleat, and ghostly\nflocks and herds answered them from under the sea. \"Baa! Baaa!\" For a\ntime they seemed to be always on the same piece of ground. There ahead\nwas stretched the sandy road with shallow puddles; the same soaking\nbushes showed on either side and the same shadowy palings. Then\nsomething immense came into view; an enormous shock-haired giant with\nhis arms stretched out. It was the big gum-tree outside Mrs. Stubbs'\nshop, and as they passed by there was a strong whiff of eucalyptus.\nAnd now big spots of light gleamed in the mist. The shepherd stopped\nwhistling; he rubbed his red nose and wet beard on his wet sleeve and,\nscrewing up his eyes, glanced in the direction of the sea. The sun\nwas rising. It was marvellous how quickly the mist thinned, sped away,\ndissolved from the shallow plain, rolled up from the bush and was gone\nas if in a hurry to escape; big twists and curls jostled and shouldered\neach other as the silvery beams broadened. The far-away sky--a bright,\npure blue--was reflected in the puddles, and the drops, swimming along\nthe telegraph poles, flashed into points of light. Now the leaping,\nglittering sea was so bright it made one's eyes ache to look at it. The\nshepherd drew a pipe, the bowl as small as an acorn, out of his breast\npocket, fumbled for a chunk of speckled tobacco, pared off a few\nshavings and stuffed the bowl. He was a grave, fine-looking old man.\nAs he lit up and the blue smoke wreathed his head, the dog, watching,\nlooked proud of him.\n\n\"Baa! Baaa!\" The sheep spread out into a fan. They were just clear of\nthe summer colony before the first sleeper turned over and lifted a\ndrowsy head; their cry sounded in the dreams of little children... who\nlifted their arms to drag down, to cuddle the darling little woolly\nlambs of sleep. Then the first inhabitant appeared; it was the Burnells'\ncat Florrie, sitting on the gatepost, far too early as usual, looking\nfor their milk-girl. When she saw the old sheep-dog she sprang up\nquickly, arched her back, drew in her tabby head, and seemed to give a\nlittle fastidious shiver. \"Ugh! What a coarse, revolting creature!\" said\nFlorrie. But the old sheep-dog, not looking up, waggled past, flinging\nout his legs from side to side. Only one of his ears twitched to prove\nthat he saw, and thought her a silly young female.\n\nThe breeze of morning lifted in the bush and the smell of leaves and wet\nblack earth mingled with the sharp smell of the sea. Myriads of birds\nwere singing. A goldfinch flew over the shepherd's head and, perching on\nthe tiptop of a spray, it turned to the sun, ruffling its small breast\nfeathers. And now they had passed the fisherman's hut, passed the\ncharred-looking little whare where Leila the milk-girl lived with her\nold Gran. The sheep strayed over a yellow swamp and Wag, the sheep-dog,\npadded after, rounded them up and headed them for the steeper, narrower\nrocky pass that led out of Crescent Bay and towards Daylight Cove. \"Baa!\nBaa!\" Faint the cry came as they rocked along the fast-drying road. The\nshepherd put away his pipe, dropping it into his breast-pocket so that\nthe little bowl hung over. And straightway the soft airy whistling began\nagain. Wag ran out along a ledge of rock after something that smelled,\nand ran back again disgusted. Then pushing, nudging, hurrying, the sheep\nrounded the bend and the shepherd followed after out of sight.\n\n\nChapter 1.II.\n\nA few moments later the back door of one of the bungalows opened, and a\nfigure in a broad-striped bathing suit flung down the paddock, cleared\nthe stile, rushed through the tussock grass into the hollow, staggered\nup the sandy hillock, and raced for dear life over the big porous\nstones, over the cold, wet pebbles, on to the hard sand that gleamed\nlike oil. Splish-Splosh! Splish-Splosh! The water bubbled round his\nlegs as Stanley Burnell waded out exulting. First man in as usual! He'd\nbeaten them all again. And he swooped down to souse his head and neck.\n\n\"Hail, brother! All hail, Thou Mighty One!\" A velvety bass voice came\nbooming over the water.\n\nGreat Scott! Damnation take it! Stanley lifted up to see a dark head\nbobbing far out and an arm lifted. It was Jonathan Trout--there before\nhim! \"Glorious morning!\" sang the voice.\n\n\"Yes, very fine!\" said Stanley briefly. Why the dickens didn't the\nfellow stick to his part of the sea? Why should he come barging over to\nthis exact spot? Stanley gave a kick, a lunge and struck out, swimming\noverarm. But Jonathan was a match for him. Up he came, his black hair\nsleek on his forehead, his short beard sleek.\n\n\"I had an extraordinary dream last night!\" he shouted.\n\nWhat was the matter with the man? This mania for conversation irritated\nStanley beyond words. And it was always the same--always some piffle\nabout a dream he'd had, or some cranky idea he'd got hold of, or some\nrot he'd been reading. Stanley turned over on his back and kicked with\nhis legs till he was a living waterspout. But even then... \"I dreamed I\nwas hanging over a terrifically high cliff, shouting to some one below.\"\nYou would be! thought Stanley. He could stick no more of it. He stopped\nsplashing. \"Look here, Trout,\" he said, \"I'm in rather a hurry this\nmorning.\"\n\n\"You're WHAT?\" Jonathan was so surprised--or pretended to be--that he\nsank under the water, then reappeared again blowing.\n\n\"All I mean is,\" said Stanley, \"I've no time to--to--to fool about.\nI want to get this over. I'm in a hurry. I've work to do this\nmorning--see?\"\n\nJonathan was gone before Stanley had finished. \"Pass, friend!\" said the\nbass voice gently, and he slid away through the water with scarcely\na ripple... But curse the fellow! He'd ruined Stanley's bathe. What an\nunpractical idiot the man was! Stanley struck out to sea again, and\nthen as quickly swam in again, and away he rushed up the beach. He felt\ncheated.\n\nJonathan stayed a little longer in the water. He floated, gently moving\nhis hands like fins, and letting the sea rock his long, skinny body. It\nwas curious, but in spite of everything he was fond of Stanley Burnell.\nTrue, he had a fiendish desire to tease him sometimes, to poke fun at\nhim, but at bottom he was sorry for the fellow. There was something\npathetic in his determination to make a job of everything. You couldn't\nhelp feeling he'd be caught out one day, and then what an almighty\ncropper he'd come! At that moment an immense wave lifted Jonathan, rode\npast him, and broke along the beach with a joyful sound. What a beauty!\nAnd now there came another. That was the way to live--carelessly,\nrecklessly, spending oneself. He got on to his feet and began to wade\ntowards the shore, pressing his toes into the firm, wrinkled sand. To\ntake things easy, not to fight against the ebb and flow of life, but to\ngive way to it--that was what was needed. It was this tension that was\nall wrong. To live--to live! And the perfect morning, so fresh and fair,\nbasking in the light, as though laughing at its own beauty, seemed to\nwhisper, \"Why not?\"\n\nBut now he was out of the water Jonathan turned blue with cold. He ached\nall over; it was as though some one was wringing the blood out of him.\nAnd stalking up the beach, shivering, all his muscles tight, he too felt\nhis bathe was spoilt. He'd stayed in too long.\n\n\nChapter 1.III.\n\nBeryl was alone in the living-room when Stanley appeared, wearing a blue\nserge suit, a stiff collar and a spotted tie. He looked almost uncannily\nclean and brushed; he was going to town for the day. Dropping into his\nchair, he pulled out his watch and put it beside his plate.\n\n\"I've just got twenty-five minutes,\" he said. \"You might go and see if\nthe porridge is ready, Beryl?\"\n\n\"Mother's just gone for it,\" said Beryl. She sat down at the table and\npoured out his tea.\n\n\"Thanks!\" Stanley took a sip. \"Hallo!\" he said in an astonished voice,\n\"you've forgotten the sugar.\"\n\n\"Oh, sorry!\" But even then Beryl didn't help him; she pushed the basin\nacross. What did this mean? As Stanley helped himself his blue\neyes widened; they seemed to quiver. He shot a quick glance at his\nsister-in-law and leaned back.\n\n\"Nothing wrong, is there?\" he asked carelessly, fingering his collar.\n\nBeryl's head was bent; she turned her plate in her fingers.\n\n\"Nothing,\" said her light voice. Then she too looked up, and smiled at\nStanley. \"Why should there be?\"\n\n\"O-oh! No reason at all as far as I know. I thought you seemed rather--\"\n\nAt that moment the door opened and the three little girls appeared, each\ncarrying a porridge plate. They were dressed alike in blue jerseys and\nknickers; their brown legs were bare, and each had her hair plaited\nand pinned up in what was called a horse's tail. Behind them came Mrs.\nFairfield with the tray.\n\n\"Carefully, children,\" she warned. But they were taking the very\ngreatest care. They loved being allowed to carry things. \"Have you said\ngood morning to your father?\"\n\n\"Yes, grandma.\" They settled themselves on the bench opposite Stanley\nand Beryl.\n\n\"Good morning, Stanley!\" Old Mrs. Fairfield gave him his plate.\n\n\"Morning, mother! How's the boy?\"\n\n\"Splendid! He only woke up once last night. What a perfect morning!\" The\nold woman paused, her hand on the loaf of bread, to gaze out of the\nopen door into the garden. The sea sounded. Through the wide-open\nwindow streamed the sun on to the yellow varnished walls and bare floor.\nEverything on the table flashed and glittered. In the middle there was\nan old salad bowl filled with yellow and red nasturtiums. She smiled,\nand a look of deep content shone in her eyes.\n\n\"You might cut me a slice of that bread, mother,\" said Stanley. \"I've\nonly twelve and a half minutes before the coach passes. Has anyone given\nmy shoes to the servant girl?\"\n\n\"Yes, they're ready for you.\" Mrs. Fairfield was quite unruffled.\n\n\"Oh, Kezia! Why are you such a messy child!\" cried Beryl despairingly.\n\n\"Me, Aunt Beryl?\" Kezia stared at her. What had she done now? She had\nonly dug a river down the middle of her porridge, filled it, and was\neating the banks away. But she did that every single morning, and no one\nhad said a word up till now.\n\n\"Why can't you eat your food properly like Isabel and Lottie?\" How\nunfair grown-ups are!\n\n\"But Lottie always makes a floating island, don't you, Lottie?\"\n\n\"I don't,\" said Isabel smartly. \"I just sprinkle mine with sugar and put\non the milk and finish it. Only babies play with their food.\"\n\nStanley pushed back his chair and got up.\n\n\"Would you get me those shoes, mother? And, Beryl, if you've finished,\nI wish you'd cut down to the gate and stop the coach. Run in to your\nmother, Isabel, and ask her where my bowler hat's been put. Wait a\nminute--have you children been playing with my stick?\"\n\n\"No, father!\"\n\n\"But I put it here.\" Stanley began to bluster. \"I remember distinctly\nputting it in this corner. Now, who's had it? There's no time to lose.\nLook sharp! The stick's got to be found.\"\n\nEven Alice, the servant-girl, was drawn into the chase. \"You haven't\nbeen using it to poke the kitchen fire with by any chance?\"\n\nStanley dashed into the bedroom where Linda was lying. \"Most\nextraordinary thing. I can't keep a single possession to myself. They've\nmade away with my stick, now!\"\n\n\"Stick, dear? What stick?\" Linda's vagueness on these occasions could\nnot be real, Stanley decided. Would nobody sympathize with him?\n\n\"Coach! Coach, Stanley!\" Beryl's voice cried from the gate.\n\nStanley waved his arm to Linda. \"No time to say good-bye!\" he cried. And\nhe meant that as a punishment to her.\n\nHe snatched his bowler hat, dashed out of the house, and swung down the\ngarden path. Yes, the coach was there waiting, and Beryl, leaning over\nthe open gate, was laughing up at somebody or other just as if nothing\nhad happened. The heartlessness of women! The way they took it for\ngranted it was your job to slave away for them while they didn't even\ntake the trouble to see that your walking-stick wasn't lost. Kelly\ntrailed his whip across the horses.\n\n\"Good-bye, Stanley,\" called Beryl, sweetly and gaily. It was easy enough\nto say good-bye! And there she stood, idle, shading her eyes with her\nhand. The worst of it was Stanley had to shout good-bye too, for the\nsake of appearances. Then he saw her turn, give a little skip and run\nback to the house. She was glad to be rid of him!\n\nYes, she was thankful. Into the living-room she ran and called \"He's\ngone!\" Linda cried from her room: \"Beryl! Has Stanley gone?\" Old Mrs.\nFairfield appeared, carrying the boy in his little flannel coatee.\n\n\"Gone?\"\n\n\"Gone!\"\n\nOh, the relief, the difference it made to have the man out of the house.\nTheir very voices were changed as they called to one another; they\nsounded warm and loving and as if they shared a secret. Beryl went over\nto the table. \"Have another cup of tea, mother. It's still hot.\" She\nwanted, somehow, to celebrate the fact that they could do what they\nliked now. There was no man to disturb them; the whole perfect day was\ntheirs.\n\n\"No, thank you, child,\" said old Mrs. Fairfield, but the way at that\nmoment she tossed the boy up and said \"a-goos-a-goos-a-ga!\" to him\nmeant that she felt the same. The little girls ran into the paddock like\nchickens let out of a coop.\n\nEven Alice, the servant-girl, washing up the dishes in the kitchen,\ncaught the infection and used the precious tank water in a perfectly\nreckless fashion.\n\n\"Oh, these men!\" said she, and she plunged the teapot into the bowl and\nheld it under the water even after it had stopped bubbling, as if it too\nwas a man and drowning was too good for them.\n\n\nChapter 1.IV.\n\n\"Wait for me, Isa-bel! Kezia, wait for me!\"\n\nThere was poor little Lottie, left behind again, because she found it so\nfearfully hard to get over the stile by herself. When she stood on the\nfirst step her knees began to wobble; she grasped the post. Then you had\nto put one leg over. But which leg? She never could decide. And when she\ndid finally put one leg over with a sort of stamp of despair--then the\nfeeling was awful. She was half in the paddock still and half in the\ntussock grass. She clutched the post desperately and lifted up her\nvoice. \"Wait for me!\"\n\n\"No, don't you wait for her, Kezia!\" said Isabel. \"She's such a little\nsilly. She's always making a fuss. Come on!\" And she tugged Kezia's\njersey. \"You can use my bucket if you come with me,\" she said kindly.\n\"It's bigger than yours.\" But Kezia couldn't leave Lottie all by\nherself. She ran back to her. By this time Lottie was very red in the\nface and breathing heavily.\n\n\"Here, put your other foot over,\" said Kezia.\n\n\"Where?\"\n\nLottie looked down at Kezia as if from a mountain height.\n\n\"Here where my hand is.\" Kezia patted the place.\n\n\"Oh, there do you mean!\" Lottie gave a deep sigh and put the second foot\nover.\n\n\"Now--sort of turn round and sit down and slide,\" said Kezia.\n\n\"But there's nothing to sit down on, Kezia,\" said Lottie.\n\nShe managed it at last, and once it was over she shook herself and began\nto beam.\n\n\"I'm getting better at climbing over stiles, aren't I, Kezia?\"\n\nLottie's was a very hopeful nature.\n\nThe pink and the blue sunbonnet followed Isabel's bright red sunbonnet\nup that sliding, slipping hill. At the top they paused to decide where\nto go and to have a good stare at who was there already. Seen from\nbehind, standing against the skyline, gesticulating largely with their\nspades, they looked like minute puzzled explorers.\n\nThe whole family of Samuel Josephs was there already with their\nlady-help, who sat on a camp-stool and kept order with a whistle that\nshe wore tied round her neck, and a small cane with which she directed\noperations. The Samuel Josephs never played by themselves or managed\ntheir own game. If they did, it ended in the boys pouring water down\nthe girls' necks or the girls trying to put little black crabs into the\nboys' pockets. So Mrs. S. J. and the poor lady-help drew up what she\ncalled a \"brogramme\" every morning to keep them \"abused and out of\nbischief.\" It was all competitions or races or round games. Everything\nbegan with a piercing blast of the lady-help's whistle and ended with\nanother. There were even prizes--large, rather dirty paper parcels which\nthe lady-help with a sour little smile drew out of a bulging string\nkit. The Samuel Josephs fought fearfully for the prizes and cheated and\npinched one another's arms--they were all expert pinchers. The only time\nthe Burnell children ever played with them Kezia had got a prize,\nand when she undid three bits of paper she found a very small rusty\nbutton-hook. She couldn't understand why they made such a fuss....\n\nBut they never played with the Samuel Josephs now or even went to their\nparties. The Samuel Josephs were always giving children's parties at\nthe Bay and there was always the same food. A big washhand basin of\nvery brown fruit-salad, buns cut into four and a washhand jug full of\nsomething the lady-help called \"Limonadear.\" And you went away in the\nevening with half the frill torn off your frock or something spilled all\ndown the front of your open-work pinafore, leaving the Samuel Josephs\nleaping like savages on their lawn. No! They were too awful.\n\nOn the other side of the beach, close down to the water, two little\nboys, their knickers rolled up, twinkled like spiders. One was digging,\nthe other pattered in and out of the water, filling a small bucket. They\nwere the Trout boys, Pip and Rags. But Pip was so busy digging and Rags\nwas so busy helping that they didn't see their little cousins until they\nwere quite close.\n\n\"Look!\" said Pip. \"Look what I've discovered.\" And he showed them an old\nwet, squashed-looking boot. The three little girls stared.\n\n\"Whatever are you going to do with it?\" asked Kezia.\n\n\"Keep it, of course!\" Pip was very scornful. \"It's a find--see?\"\n\nYes, Kezia saw that. All the same....\n\n\"There's lots of things buried in the sand,\" explained Pip. \"They get\nchucked up from wrecks. Treasure. Why--you might find--\"\n\n\"But why does Rags have to keep on pouring water in?\" asked Lottie.\n\n\"Oh, that's to moisten it,\" said Pip, \"to make the work a bit easier.\nKeep it up, Rags.\"\n\nAnd good little Rags ran up and down, pouring in the water that turned\nbrown like cocoa.\n\n\"Here, shall I show you what I found yesterday?\" said Pip mysteriously,\nand he stuck his spade into the sand. \"Promise not to tell.\"\n\nThey promised.\n\n\"Say, cross my heart straight dinkum.\"\n\nThe little girls said it.\n\nPip took something out of his pocket, rubbed it a long time on the front\nof his jersey, then breathed on it and rubbed it again.\n\n\"Now turn round!\" he ordered.\n\nThey turned round.\n\n\"All look the same way! Keep still! Now!\"\n\nAnd his hand opened; he held up to the light something that flashed,\nthat winked, that was a most lovely green.\n\n\"It's a nemeral,\" said Pip solemnly.\n\n\"Is it really, Pip?\" Even Isabel was impressed.\n\nThe lovely green thing seemed to dance in Pip's fingers. Aunt Beryl had\na nemeral in a ring, but it was a very small one. This one was as big as\na star and far more beautiful.\n\n\nChapter 1.V.\n\nAs the morning lengthened whole parties appeared over the sand-hills\nand came down on the beach to bathe. It was understood that at eleven\no'clock the women and children of the summer colony had the sea to\nthemselves. First the women undressed, pulled on their bathing dresses\nand covered their heads in hideous caps like sponge bags; then the\nchildren were unbuttoned. The beach was strewn with little heaps of\nclothes and shoes; the big summer hats, with stones on them to keep them\nfrom blowing away, looked like immense shells. It was strange that even\nthe sea seemed to sound differently when all those leaping, laughing\nfigures ran into the waves. Old Mrs. Fairfield, in a lilac cotton dress\nand a black hat tied under the chin, gathered her little brood and got\nthem ready. The little Trout boys whipped their shirts over their heads,\nand away the five sped, while their grandma sat with one hand in her\nknitting-bag ready to draw out the ball of wool when she was satisfied\nthey were safely in.\n\nThe firm compact little girls were not half so brave as the tender,\ndelicate-looking little boys. Pip and Rags, shivering, crouching down,\nslapping the water, never hesitated. But Isabel, who could swim twelve\nstrokes, and Kezia, who could nearly swim eight, only followed on the\nstrict understanding they were not to be splashed. As for Lottie, she\ndidn't follow at all. She liked to be left to go in her own way,\nplease. And that way was to sit down at the edge of the water, her legs\nstraight, her knees pressed together, and to make vague motions with her\narms as if she expected to be wafted out to sea. But when a bigger wave\nthan usual, an old whiskery one, came lolloping along in her direction,\nshe scrambled to her feet with a face of horror and flew up the beach\nagain.\n\n\"Here, mother, keep those for me, will you?\"\n\nTwo rings and a thin gold chain were dropped into Mrs Fairfield's lap.\n\n\"Yes, dear. But aren't you going to bathe here?\"\n\n\"No-o,\" Beryl drawled. She sounded vague. \"I'm undressing farther along.\nI'm going to bathe with Mrs. Harry Kember.\"\n\n\"Very well.\" But Mrs. Fairfield's lips set. She disapproved of Mrs Harry\nKember. Beryl knew it.\n\nPoor old mother, she smiled, as she skimmed over the stones. Poor old\nmother! Old! Oh, what joy, what bliss it was to be young....\n\n\"You look very pleased,\" said Mrs. Harry Kember. She sat hunched up on\nthe stones, her arms round her knees, smoking.\n\n\"It's such a lovely day,\" said Beryl, smiling down at her.\n\n\"Oh my dear!\" Mrs. Harry Kember's voice sounded as though she knew\nbetter than that. But then her voice always sounded as though she\nknew something better about you than you did yourself. She was a long,\nstrange-looking woman with narrow hands and feet. Her face, too, was\nlong and narrow and exhausted-looking; even her fair curled fringe\nlooked burnt out and withered. She was the only woman at the Bay who\nsmoked, and she smoked incessantly, keeping the cigarette between her\nlips while she talked, and only taking it out when the ash was so long\nyou could not understand why it did not fall. When she was not playing\nbridge--she played bridge every day of her life--she spent her time\nlying in the full glare of the sun. She could stand any amount of\nit; she never had enough. All the same, it did not seem to warm her.\nParched, withered, cold, she lay stretched on the stones like a piece\nof tossed-up driftwood. The women at the Bay thought she was very, very\nfast. Her lack of vanity, her slang, the way she treated men as though\nshe was one of them, and the fact that she didn't care twopence about\nher house and called the servant Gladys \"Glad-eyes,\" was disgraceful.\nStanding on the veranda steps Mrs. Kember would call in her indifferent,\ntired voice, \"I say, Glad-eyes, you might heave me a handkerchief if\nI've got one, will you?\" And Glad-eyes, a red bow in her hair instead of\na cap, and white shoes, came running with an impudent smile. It was an\nabsolute scandal! True, she had no children, and her husband... Here the\nvoices were always raised; they became fervent. How can he have married\nher? How can he, how can he? It must have been money, of course, but\neven then!\n\nMrs. Kember's husband was at least ten years younger than she was, and\nso incredibly handsome that he looked like a mask or a most perfect\nillustration in an American novel rather than a man. Black hair, dark\nblue eyes, red lips, a slow sleepy smile, a fine tennis player, a\nperfect dancer, and with it all a mystery. Harry Kember was like a man\nwalking in his sleep. Men couldn't stand him, they couldn't get a word\nout of the chap; he ignored his wife just as she ignored him. How did\nhe live? Of course there were stories, but such stories! They simply\ncouldn't be told. The women he'd been seen with, the places he'd been\nseen in... but nothing was ever certain, nothing definite. Some of the\nwomen at the Bay privately thought he'd commit a murder one day. Yes,\neven while they talked to Mrs. Kember and took in the awful concoction\nshe was wearing, they saw her, stretched as she lay on the beach; but\ncold, bloody, and still with a cigarette stuck in the corner of her\nmouth.\n\nMrs. Kember rose, yawned, unsnapped her belt buckle, and tugged at the\ntape of her blouse. And Beryl stepped out of her skirt and shed her\njersey, and stood up in her short white petticoat, and her camisole with\nribbon bows on the shoulders.\n\n\"Mercy on us,\" said Mrs. Harry Kember, \"what a little beauty you are!\"\n\n\"Don't!\" said Beryl softly; but, drawing off one stocking and then the\nother, she felt a little beauty.\n\n\"My dear--why not?\" said Mrs. Harry Kember, stamping on her own\npetticoat. Really--her underclothes! A pair of blue cotton knickers and\na linen bodice that reminded one somehow of a pillow-case... \"And you\ndon't wear stays, do you?\" She touched Beryl's waist, and Beryl sprang\naway with a small affected cry. Then \"Never!\" she said firmly.\n\n\"Lucky little creature,\" sighed Mrs. Kember, unfastening her own.\n\nBeryl turned her back and began the complicated movements of some one\nwho is trying to take off her clothes and to pull on her bathing-dress\nall at one and the same time.\n\n\"Oh, my dear--don't mind me,\" said Mrs. Harry Kember. \"Why be shy? I\nshan't eat you. I shan't be shocked like those other ninnies.\" And she\ngave her strange neighing laugh and grimaced at the other women.\n\nBut Beryl was shy. She never undressed in front of anybody. Was that\nsilly? Mrs. Harry Kember made her feel it was silly, even something\nto be ashamed of. Why be shy indeed! She glanced quickly at her friend\nstanding so boldly in her torn chemise and lighting a fresh cigarette;\nand a quick, bold, evil feeling started up in her breast. Laughing\nrecklessly, she drew on the limp, sandy-feeling bathing-dress that was\nnot quite dry and fastened the twisted buttons.\n\n\"That's better,\" said Mrs. Harry Kember. They began to go down the\nbeach together. \"Really, it's a sin for you to wear clothes, my dear.\nSomebody's got to tell you some day.\"\n\nThe water was quite warm. It was that marvellous transparent blue,\nflecked with silver, but the sand at the bottom looked gold; when you\nkicked with your toes there rose a little puff of gold-dust. Now the\nwaves just reached her breast. Beryl stood, her arms outstretched,\ngazing out, and as each wave came she gave the slightest little jump, so\nthat it seemed it was the wave which lifted her so gently.\n\n\"I believe in pretty girls having a good time,\" said Mrs. Harry Kember.\n\"Why not? Don't you make a mistake, my dear. Enjoy yourself.\" And\nsuddenly she turned turtle, disappeared, and swam away quickly, quickly,\nlike a rat. Then she flicked round and began swimming back. She was\ngoing to say something else. Beryl felt that she was being poisoned\nby this cold woman, but she longed to hear. But oh, how strange, how\nhorrible! As Mrs. Harry Kember came up close she looked, in her black\nwaterproof bathing-cap, with her sleepy face lifted above the water,\njust her chin touching, like a horrible caricature of her husband.\n\n\nChapter 1.VI.\n\nIn a steamer chair, under a manuka tree that grew in the middle of\nthe front grass patch, Linda Burnell dreamed the morning away. She did\nnothing. She looked up at the dark, close, dry leaves of the manuka, at\nthe chinks of blue between, and now and again a tiny yellowish flower\ndropped on her. Pretty--yes, if you held one of those flowers on the\npalm of your hand and looked at it closely, it was an exquisite small\nthing. Each pale yellow petal shone as if each was the careful work of a\nloving hand. The tiny tongue in the centre gave it the shape of a bell.\nAnd when you turned it over the outside was a deep bronze colour. But\nas soon as they flowered, they fell and were scattered. You brushed them\noff your frock as you talked; the horrid little things got caught in\none's hair. Why, then, flower at all? Who takes the trouble--or the\njoy--to make all these things that are wasted, wasted... It was uncanny.\n\nOn the grass beside her, lying between two pillows, was the boy. Sound\nasleep he lay, his head turned away from his mother. His fine dark hair\nlooked more like a shadow than like real hair, but his ear was a bright,\ndeep coral. Linda clasped her hands above her head and crossed her feet.\nIt was very pleasant to know that all these bungalows were empty, that\neverybody was down on the beach, out of sight, out of hearing. She had\nthe garden to herself; she was alone.\n\nDazzling white the picotees shone; the golden-eyed marigold glittered;\nthe nasturtiums wreathed the veranda poles in green and gold flame. If\nonly one had time to look at these flowers long enough, time to get over\nthe sense of novelty and strangeness, time to know them! But as soon as\none paused to part the petals, to discover the under-side of the leaf,\nalong came Life and one was swept away. And, lying in her cane chair,\nLinda felt so light; she felt like a leaf. Along came Life like a wind\nand she was seized and shaken; she had to go. Oh dear, would it always\nbe so? Was there no escape?\n\n... Now she sat on the veranda of their Tasmanian home, leaning against\nher father's knee. And he promised, \"As soon as you and I are old\nenough, Linny, we'll cut off somewhere, we'll escape. Two boys together.\nI have a fancy I'd like to sail up a river in China.\" Linda saw that\nriver, very wide, covered with little rafts and boats. She saw the\nyellow hats of the boatmen and she heard their high, thin voices as they\ncalled...\n\n\"Yes, papa.\"\n\nBut just then a very broad young man with bright ginger hair walked\nslowly past their house, and slowly, solemnly even, uncovered. Linda's\nfather pulled her ear teasingly, in the way he had.\n\n\"Linny's beau,\" he whispered.\n\n\"Oh, papa, fancy being married to Stanley Burnell!\"\n\nWell, she was married to him. And what was more she loved him. Not\nthe Stanley whom every one saw, not the everyday one; but a timid,\nsensitive, innocent Stanley who knelt down every night to say his\nprayers, and who longed to be good. Stanley was simple. If he believed\nin people--as he believed in her, for instance--it was with his whole\nheart. He could not be disloyal; he could not tell a lie. And how\nterribly he suffered if he thought any one--she--was not being dead\nstraight, dead sincere with him! \"This is too subtle for me!\" He flung\nout the words, but his open, quivering, distraught look was like the\nlook of a trapped beast.\n\nBut the trouble was--here Linda felt almost inclined to laugh, though\nHeaven knows it was no laughing matter--she saw her Stanley so seldom.\nThere were glimpses, moments, breathing spaces of calm, but all the rest\nof the time it was like living in a house that couldn't be cured of the\nhabit of catching on fire, on a ship that got wrecked every day. And it\nwas always Stanley who was in the thick of the danger. Her whole time\nwas spent in rescuing him, and restoring him, and calming him down, and\nlistening to his story. And what was left of her time was spent in the\ndread of having children.\n\nLinda frowned; she sat up quickly in her steamer chair and clasped her\nankles. Yes, that was her real grudge against life; that was what she\ncould not understand. That was the question she asked and asked, and\nlistened in vain for the answer. It was all very well to say it was\nthe common lot of women to bear children. It wasn't true. She, for one,\ncould prove that wrong. She was broken, made weak, her courage was gone,\nthrough child-bearing. And what made it doubly hard to bear was, she did\nnot love her children. It was useless pretending. Even if she had had\nthe strength she never would have nursed and played with the little\ngirls. No, it was as though a cold breath had chilled her through and\nthrough on each of those awful journeys; she had no warmth left to give\nthem. As to the boy--well, thank Heaven, mother had taken him; he was\nmother's, or Beryl's, or anybody's who wanted him. She had hardly\nheld him in her arms. She was so indifferent about him that as he lay\nthere... Linda glanced down.\n\nThe boy had turned over. He lay facing her, and he was no longer asleep.\nHis dark-blue, baby eyes were open; he looked as though he was peeping\nat his mother. And suddenly his face dimpled; it broke into a wide,\ntoothless smile, a perfect beam, no less.\n\n\"I'm here!\" that happy smile seemed to say. \"Why don't you like me?\"\n\nThere was something so quaint, so unexpected about that smile that Linda\nsmiled herself. But she checked herself and said to the boy coldly, \"I\ndon't like babies.\"\n\n\"Don't like babies?\" The boy couldn't believe her. \"Don't like me?\" He\nwaved his arms foolishly at his mother.\n\nLinda dropped off her chair on to the grass.\n\n\"Why do you keep on smiling?\" she said severely. \"If you knew what I was\nthinking about, you wouldn't.\"\n\nBut he only squeezed up his eyes, slyly, and rolled his head on the\npillow. He didn't believe a word she said.\n\n\"We know all about that!\" smiled the boy.\n\nLinda was so astonished at the confidence of this little creature... Ah\nno, be sincere. That was not what she felt; it was something far\ndifferent, it was something so new, so... The tears danced in her eyes;\nshe breathed in a small whisper to the boy, \"Hallo, my funny!\"\n\nBut by now the boy had forgotten his mother. He was serious again.\nSomething pink, something soft waved in front of him. He made a grab at\nit and it immediately disappeared. But when he lay back, another, like\nthe first, appeared. This time he determined to catch it. He made a\ntremendous effort and rolled right over.\n\n\nChapter 1.VII.\n\nThe tide was out; the beach was deserted; lazily flopped the warm sea.\nThe sun beat down, beat down hot and fiery on the fine sand, baking\nthe grey and blue and black and white-veined pebbles. It sucked up the\nlittle drop of water that lay in the hollow of the curved shells; it\nbleached the pink convolvulus that threaded through and through\nthe sand-hills. Nothing seemed to move but the small sand-hoppers.\nPit-pit-pit! They were never still.\n\nOver there on the weed-hung rocks that looked at low tide like shaggy\nbeasts come down to the water to drink, the sunlight seemed to spin like\na silver coin dropped into each of the small rock pools. They danced,\nthey quivered, and minute ripples laved the porous shores. Looking\ndown, bending over, each pool was like a lake with pink and blue houses\nclustered on the shores; and oh! the vast mountainous country behind\nthose houses--the ravines, the passes, the dangerous creeks and\nfearful tracks that led to the water's edge. Underneath waved the\nsea-forest--pink thread-like trees, velvet anemones, and orange\nberry-spotted weeds. Now a stone on the bottom moved, rocked, and there\nwas a glimpse of a black feeler; now a thread-like creature wavered by\nand was lost. Something was happening to the pink, waving trees; they\nwere changing to a cold moonlight blue. And now there sounded the\nfaintest \"plop.\" Who made that sound? What was going on down there? And\nhow strong, how damp the seaweed smelt in the hot sun...\n\nThe green blinds were drawn in the bungalows of the summer colony. Over\nthe verandas, prone on the paddock, flung over the fences, there were\nexhausted-looking bathing-dresses and rough striped towels. Each back\nwindow seemed to have a pair of sand-shoes on the sill and some lumps of\nrock or a bucket or a collection of pawa shells. The bush quivered in\na haze of heat; the sandy road was empty except for the Trouts' dog\nSnooker, who lay stretched in the very middle of it. His blue eye\nwas turned up, his legs stuck out stiffly, and he gave an occasional\ndesperate-sounding puff, as much as to say he had decided to make an end\nof it and was only waiting for some kind cart to come along.\n\n\"What are you looking at, my grandma? Why do you keep stopping and sort\nof staring at the wall?\"\n\nKezia and her grandmother were taking their siesta together. The little\ngirl, wearing only her short drawers and her under-bodice, her arms and\nlegs bare, lay on one of the puffed-up pillows of her grandma's bed, and\nthe old woman, in a white ruffled dressing-gown, sat in a rocker at the\nwindow, with a long piece of pink knitting in her lap. This room\nthat they shared, like the other rooms of the bungalow, was of light\nvarnished wood and the floor was bare. The furniture was of the\nshabbiest, the simplest. The dressing-table, for instance, was a\npacking-case in a sprigged muslin petticoat, and the mirror above was\nvery strange; it was as though a little piece of forked lightning was\nimprisoned in it. On the table there stood a jar of sea-pinks, pressed\nso tightly together they looked more like a velvet pincushion, and a\nspecial shell which Kezia had given her grandma for a pin-tray, and\nanother even more special which she had thought would make a very nice\nplace for a watch to curl up in.\n\n\"Tell me, grandma,\" said Kezia.\n\nThe old woman sighed, whipped the wool twice round her thumb, and drew\nthe bone needle through. She was casting on.\n\n\"I was thinking of your Uncle William, darling,\" she said quietly.\n\n\"My Australian Uncle William?\" said Kezia. She had another.\n\n\"Yes, of course.\"\n\n\"The one I never saw?\"\n\n\"That was the one.\"\n\n\"Well, what happened to him?\" Kezia knew perfectly well, but she wanted\nto be told again.\n\n\"He went to the mines, and he got a sunstroke there and died,\" said old\nMrs. Fairfield.\n\nKezia blinked and considered the picture again... a little man fallen\nover like a tin soldier by the side of a big black hole.\n\n\"Does it make you sad to think about him, grandma?\" She hated her\ngrandma to be sad.\n\nIt was the old woman's turn to consider. Did it make her sad? To look\nback, back. To stare down the years, as Kezia had seen her doing. To\nlook after them as a woman does, long after they were out of sight. Did\nit make her sad? No, life was like that.\n\n\"No, Kezia.\"\n\n\"But why?\" asked Kezia. She lifted one bare arm and began to draw things\nin the air. \"Why did Uncle William have to die? He wasn't old.\"\n\nMrs. Fairfield began counting the stitches in threes. \"It just\nhappened,\" she said in an absorbed voice.\n\n\"Does everybody have to die?\" asked Kezia.\n\n\"Everybody!\"\n\n\"Me?\" Kezia sounded fearfully incredulous.\n\n\"Some day, my darling.\"\n\n\"But, grandma.\" Kezia waved her left leg and waggled the toes. They felt\nsandy. \"What if I just won't?\"\n\nThe old woman sighed again and drew a long thread from the ball.\n\n\"We're not asked, Kezia,\" she said sadly. \"It happens to all of us\nsooner or later.\"\n\nKezia lay still thinking this over. She didn't want to die. It meant she\nwould have to leave here, leave everywhere, for ever, leave--leave her\ngrandma. She rolled over quickly.\n\n\"Grandma,\" she said in a startled voice.\n\n\"What, my pet!\"\n\n\"You're not to die.\" Kezia was very decided.\n\n\"Ah, Kezia\"--her grandma looked up and smiled and shook her head--\"don't\nlet's talk about it.\"\n\n\"But you're not to. You couldn't leave me. You couldn't not be there.\"\nThis was awful. \"Promise me you won't ever do it, grandma,\" pleaded\nKezia.\n\nThe old woman went on knitting.\n\n\"Promise me! Say never!\"\n\nBut still her grandma was silent.\n\nKezia rolled off her bed; she couldn't bear it any longer, and lightly\nshe leapt on to her grandma's knees, clasped her hands round the old\nwoman's throat and began kissing her, under the chin, behind the ear,\nand blowing down her neck.\n\n\"Say never... say never... say never--\" She gasped between the kisses. And\nthen she began, very softly and lightly, to tickle her grandma.\n\n\"Kezia!\" The old woman dropped her knitting. She swung back in the\nrocker. She began to tickle Kezia. \"Say never, say never, say never,\"\ngurgled Kezia, while they lay there laughing in each other's arms.\n\"Come, that's enough, my squirrel! That's enough, my wild pony!\" said\nold Mrs. Fairfield, setting her cap straight. \"Pick up my knitting.\"\n\nBoth of them had forgotten what the \"never\" was about.\n\n\nChapter 1.VIII.\n\nThe sun was still full on the garden when the back door of the Burnells'\nshut with a bang, and a very gay figure walked down the path to the\ngate. It was Alice, the servant-girl, dressed for her afternoon out. She\nwore a white cotton dress with such large red spots on it and so many\nthat they made you shudder, white shoes and a leghorn turned up under\nthe brim with poppies. Of course she wore gloves, white ones, stained\nat the fastenings with iron-mould, and in one hand she carried a very\ndashed-looking sunshade which she referred to as her \"perishall.\"\n\nBeryl, sitting in the window, fanning her freshly-washed hair, thought\nshe had never seen such a guy. If Alice had only blacked her face with\na piece of cork before she started out, the picture would have been\ncomplete. And where did a girl like that go to in a place like this? The\nheart-shaped Fijian fan beat scornfully at that lovely bright mane. She\nsupposed Alice had picked up some horrible common larrikin and they'd\ngo off into the bush together. Pity to have made herself so conspicuous;\nthey'd have hard work to hide with Alice in that rig-out.\n\nBut no, Beryl was unfair. Alice was going to tea with Mrs Stubbs, who'd\nsent her an \"invite\" by the little boy who called for orders. She had\ntaken ever such a liking to Mrs. Stubbs ever since the first time she\nwent to the shop to get something for her mosquitoes.\n\n\"Dear heart!\" Mrs. Stubbs had clapped her hand to her side. \"I never\nseen anyone so eaten. You might have been attacked by canningbals.\"\n\nAlice did wish there'd been a bit of life on the road though. Made her\nfeel so queer, having nobody behind her. Made her feel all weak in the\nspine. She couldn't believe that some one wasn't watching her. And yet\nit was silly to turn round; it gave you away. She pulled up her gloves,\nhummed to herself and said to the distant gum-tree, \"Shan't be long\nnow.\" But that was hardly company.\n\nMrs. Stubbs's shop was perched on a little hillock just off the road. It\nhad two big windows for eyes, a broad veranda for a hat, and the sign on\nthe roof, scrawled MRS. STUBBS'S, was like a little card stuck rakishly\nin the hat crown.\n\nOn the veranda there hung a long string of bathing-dresses, clinging\ntogether as though they'd just been rescued from the sea rather than\nwaiting to go in, and beside them there hung a cluster of sandshoes so\nextraordinarily mixed that to get at one pair you had to tear apart and\nforcibly separate at least fifty. Even then it was the rarest thing\nto find the left that belonged to the right. So many people had lost\npatience and gone off with one shoe that fitted and one that was a\nlittle too big... Mrs. Stubbs prided herself on keeping something\nof everything. The two windows, arranged in the form of precarious\npyramids, were crammed so tight, piled so high, that it seemed only a\nconjurer could prevent them from toppling over. In the left-hand corner\nof one window, glued to the pane by four gelatine lozenges, there\nwas--and there had been from time immemorial--a notice.\n\nLOST! HANSOME GOLE BROOCH SOLID GOLD ON OR NEAR BEACH REWARD OFFERED\n\nAlice pressed open the door. The bell jangled, the red serge curtains\nparted, and Mrs. Stubbs appeared. With her broad smile and the long\nbacon knife in her hand, she looked like a friendly brigand. Alice was\nwelcomed so warmly that she found it quite difficult to keep up her\n\"manners.\" They consisted of persistent little coughs and hems, pulls at\nher gloves, tweaks at her skirt, and a curious difficulty in seeing what\nwas set before her or understanding what was said.\n\nTea was laid on the parlour table--ham, sardines, a whole pound\nof butter, and such a large johnny cake that it looked like an\nadvertisement for somebody's baking-powder. But the Primus stove roared\nso loudly that it was useless to try to talk above it. Alice sat down\non the edge of a basket-chair while Mrs. Stubbs pumped the stove\nstill higher. Suddenly Mrs. Stubbs whipped the cushion off a chair and\ndisclosed a large brown-paper parcel.\n\n\"I've just had some new photers taken, my dear,\" she shouted cheerfully\nto Alice. \"Tell me what you think of them.\"\n\nIn a very dainty, refined way Alice wet her finger and put the tissue\nback from the first one. Life! How many there were! There were three\ndozzing at least. And she held it up to the light.\n\nMrs. Stubbs sat in an arm-chair, leaning very much to one side. There\nwas a look of mild astonishment on her large face, and well there might\nbe. For though the arm-chair stood on a carpet, to the left of it,\nmiraculously skirting the carpet-border, there was a dashing water-fall.\nOn her right stood a Grecian pillar with a giant fern-tree on either\nside of it, and in the background towered a gaunt mountain, pale with\nsnow.\n\n\"It is a nice style, isn't it?\" shouted Mrs. Stubbs; and Alice had\njust screamed \"Sweetly\" when the roaring of the Primus stove died\ndown, fizzled out, ceased, and she said \"Pretty\" in a silence that was\nfrightening.\n\n\"Draw up your chair, my dear,\" said Mrs. Stubbs, beginning to pour out.\n\"Yes,\" she said thoughtfully, as she handed the tea, \"but I don't care\nabout the size. I'm having an enlargemint. All very well for Christmas\ncards, but I never was the one for small photers myself. You get no\ncomfort out of them. To say the truth, I find them dis'eartening.\"\n\nAlice quite saw what she meant.\n\n\"Size,\" said Mrs. Stubbs. \"Give me size. That was what my poor dear\nhusband was always saying. He couldn't stand anything small. Gave him\nthe creeps. And, strange as it may seem, my dear\"--here Mrs. Stubbs\ncreaked and seemed to expand herself at the memory--\"it was dropsy that\ncarried him off at the larst. Many's the time they drawn one and a half\npints from 'im at the 'ospital... It seemed like a judgmint.\"\n\nAlice burned to know exactly what it was that was drawn from him. She\nventured, \"I suppose it was water.\"\n\nBut Mrs. Stubbs fixed Alice with her eyes and replied meaningly, \"It was\nliquid, my dear.\"\n\nLiquid! Alice jumped away from the word like a cat and came back to it,\nnosing and wary.\n\n\"That's 'im!\" said Mrs. Stubbs, and she pointed dramatically to the\nlife-size head and shoulders of a burly man with a dead white rose in\nthe buttonhole of his coat that made you think of a curl of cold mutting\nfat. Just below, in silver letters on a red cardboard ground, were the\nwords, \"Be not afraid, it is I.\"\n\n\"It's ever such a fine face,\" said Alice faintly.\n\nThe pale-blue bow on the top of Mrs. Stubbs's fair frizzy hair quivered.\nShe arched her plump neck. What a neck she had! It was bright pink where\nit began and then it changed to warm apricot, and that faded to the\ncolour of a brown egg and then to a deep creamy.\n\n\"All the same, my dear,\" she said surprisingly, \"freedom's best!\" Her\nsoft, fat chuckle sounded like a purr. \"Freedom's best,\" said Mrs.\nStubbs again.\n\nFreedom! Alice gave a loud, silly little titter. She felt awkward. Her\nmind flew back to her own kitching. Ever so queer! She wanted to be back\nin it again.\n\n\nChapter 1.IX.\n\nA strange company assembled in the Burnells' washhouse after tea. Round\nthe table there sat a bull, a rooster, a donkey that kept forgetting it\nwas a donkey, a sheep and a bee. The washhouse was the perfect place for\nsuch a meeting because they could make as much noise as they liked, and\nnobody ever interrupted. It was a small tin shed standing apart from the\nbungalow. Against the wall there was a deep trough and in the corner a\ncopper with a basket of clothes-pegs on top of it. The little window,\nspun over with cobwebs, had a piece of candle and a mouse-trap on the\ndusty sill. There were clotheslines criss-crossed overhead and, hanging\nfrom a peg on the wall, a very big, a huge, rusty horseshoe. The table\nwas in the middle with a form at either side.\n\n\"You can't be a bee, Kezia. A bee's not an animal. It's a ninseck.\"\n\n\"Oh, but I do want to be a bee frightfully,\" wailed Kezia... A tiny bee,\nall yellow-furry, with striped legs. She drew her legs up under her and\nleaned over the table. She felt she was a bee.\n\n\"A ninseck must be an animal,\" she said stoutly. \"It makes a noise. It's\nnot like a fish.\"\n\n\"I'm a bull, I'm a bull!\" cried Pip. And he gave such a tremendous\nbellow--how did he make that noise?--that Lottie looked quite alarmed.\n\n\"I'll be a sheep,\" said little Rags. \"A whole lot of sheep went past\nthis morning.\"\n\n\"How do you know?\"\n\n\"Dad heard them. Baa!\" He sounded like the little lamb that trots behind\nand seems to wait to be carried.\n\n\"Cock-a-doodle-do!\" shrilled Isabel. With her red cheeks and bright eyes\nshe looked like a rooster.\n\n\"What'll I be?\" Lottie asked everybody, and she sat there smiling,\nwaiting for them to decide for her. It had to be an easy one.\n\n\"Be a donkey, Lottie.\" It was Kezia's suggestion. \"Hee-haw! You can't\nforget that.\"\n\n\"Hee-haw!\" said Lottie solemnly. \"When do I have to say it?\"\n\n\"I'll explain, I'll explain,\" said the bull. It was he who had the\ncards. He waved them round his head. \"All be quiet! All listen!\" And he\nwaited for them. \"Look here, Lottie.\" He turned up a card. \"It's got two\nspots on it--see? Now, if you put that card in the middle and somebody\nelse has one with two spots as well, you say 'Hee-haw,' and the card's\nyours.\"\n\n\"Mine?\" Lottie was round-eyed. \"To keep?\"\n\n\"No, silly. Just for the game, see? Just while we're playing.\" The bull\nwas very cross with her.\n\n\"Oh, Lottie, you are a little silly,\" said the proud rooster.\n\nLottie looked at both of them. Then she hung her head; her lip quivered.\n\"I don't want to play,\" she whispered. The others glanced at one another\nlike conspirators. All of them knew what that meant. She would go away\nand be discovered somewhere standing with her pinny thrown over her\nhead, in a corner, or against a wall, or even behind a chair.\n\n\"Yes, you do, Lottie. It's quite easy,\" said Kezia.\n\nAnd Isabel, repentant, said exactly like a grown-up, \"Watch me, Lottie,\nand you'll soon learn.\"\n\n\"Cheer up, Lot,\" said Pip. \"There, I know what I'll do. I'll give you\nthe first one. It's mine, really, but I'll give it to you. Here you\nare.\" And he slammed the card down in front of Lottie.\n\nLottie revived at that. But now she was in another difficulty. \"I\nhaven't got a hanky,\" she said; \"I want one badly, too.\"\n\n\"Here, Lottie, you can use mine.\" Rags dipped into his sailor blouse and\nbrought up a very wet-looking one, knotted together. \"Be very careful,\"\nhe warned her. \"Only use that corner. Don't undo it. I've got a little\nstarfish inside I'm going to try and tame.\"\n\n\"Oh, come on, you girls,\" said the bull. \"And mind--you're not to look\nat your cards. You've got to keep your hands under the table till I say\n'Go.'\"\n\nSmack went the cards round the table. They tried with all their might to\nsee, but Pip was too quick for them. It was very exciting, sitting there\nin the washhouse; it was all they could do not to burst into a little\nchorus of animals before Pip had finished dealing.\n\n\"Now, Lottie, you begin.\"\n\nTimidly Lottie stretched out a hand, took the top card off her pack, had\na good look at it--it was plain she was counting the spots--and put it\ndown.\n\n\"No, Lottie, you can't do that. You mustn't look first. You must turn it\nthe other way over.\"\n\n\"But then everybody will see it the same time as me,\" said Lottie.\n\nThe game proceeded. Mooe-ooo-er! The bull was terrible. He charged over\nthe table and seemed to eat the cards up.\n\nBss-ss! said the bee.\n\nCock-a-doodle-do! Isabel stood up in her excitement and moved her elbows\nlike wings.\n\nBaa! Little Rags put down the King of Diamonds and Lottie put down the\none they called the King of Spain. She had hardly any cards left.\n\n\"Why don't you call out, Lottie?\"\n\n\"I've forgotten what I am,\" said the donkey woefully.\n\n\"Well, change! Be a dog instead! Bow-wow!\"\n\n\"Oh yes. That's much easier.\" Lottie smiled again. But when she and\nKezia both had a one Kezia waited on purpose. The others made signs to\nLottie and pointed. Lottie turned very red; she looked bewildered, and\nat last she said, \"Hee-haw! Ke-zia.\"\n\n\"Ss! Wait a minute!\" They were in the very thick of it when the bull\nstopped them, holding up his hand. \"What's that? What's that noise?\"\n\n\"What noise? What do you mean?\" asked the rooster.\n\n\"Ss! Shut up! Listen!\" They were mouse-still. \"I thought I heard a--a\nsort of knocking,\" said the bull.\n\n\"What was it like?\" asked the sheep faintly.\n\nNo answer.\n\nThe bee gave a shudder. \"Whatever did we shut the door for?\" she said\nsoftly. Oh, why, why had they shut the door?\n\nWhile they were playing, the day had faded; the gorgeous sunset had\nblazed and died. And now the quick dark came racing over the sea, over\nthe sand-hills, up the paddock. You were frightened to look in the\ncorners of the washhouse, and yet you had to look with all your might.\nAnd somewhere, far away, grandma was lighting a lamp. The blinds\nwere being pulled down; the kitchen fire leapt in the tins on the\nmantelpiece.\n\n\"It would be awful now,\" said the bull, \"if a spider was to fall from\nthe ceiling on to the table, wouldn't it?\"\n\n\"Spiders don't fall from ceilings.\"\n\n\"Yes, they do. Our Min told us she'd seen a spider as big as a saucer,\nwith long hairs on it like a gooseberry.\"\n\nQuickly all the little heads were jerked up; all the little bodies drew\ntogether, pressed together.\n\n\"Why doesn't somebody come and call us?\" cried the rooster.\n\nOh, those grown-ups, laughing and snug, sitting in the lamp-light,\ndrinking out of cups! They'd forgotten about them. No, not really\nforgotten. That was what their smile meant. They had decided to leave\nthem there all by themselves.\n\nSuddenly Lottie gave such a piercing scream that all of them jumped off\nthe forms, all of them screamed too. \"A face--a face looking!\" shrieked\nLottie.\n\nIt was true, it was real. Pressed against the window was a pale face,\nblack eyes, a black beard.\n\n\"Grandma! Mother! Somebody!\"\n\nBut they had not got to the door, tumbling over one another, before it\nopened for Uncle Jonathan. He had come to take the little boys home.\n\n\nChapter 1.X.\n\nHe had meant to be there before, but in the front garden he had come\nupon Linda walking up and down the grass, stopping to pick off a dead\npink or give a top-heavy carnation something to lean against, or to take\na deep breath of something, and then walking on again, with her little\nair of remoteness. Over her white frock she wore a yellow, pink-fringed\nshawl from the Chinaman's shop.\n\n\"Hallo, Jonathan!\" called Linda. And Jonathan whipped off his shabby\npanama, pressed it against his breast, dropped on one knee, and kissed\nLinda's hand.\n\n\"Greeting, my Fair One! Greeting, my Celestial Peach Blossom!\" boomed\nthe bass voice gently. \"Where are the other noble dames?\"\n\n\"Beryl's out playing bridge and mother's giving the boy his bath... Have\nyou come to borrow something?\"\n\nThe Trouts were for ever running out of things and sending across to the\nBurnells' at the last moment.\n\nBut Jonathan only answered, \"A little love, a little kindness;\" and he\nwalked by his sister-in-law's side.\n\nLinda dropped into Beryl's hammock under the manuka-tree, and Jonathan\nstretched himself on the grass beside her, pulled a long stalk and began\nchewing it. They knew each other well. The voices of children cried from\nthe other gardens. A fisherman's light cart shook along the sandy road,\nand from far away they heard a dog barking; it was muffled as though the\ndog had its head in a sack. If you listened you could just hear the soft\nswish of the sea at full tide sweeping the pebbles. The sun was sinking.\n\n\"And so you go back to the office on Monday, do you, Jonathan?\" asked\nLinda.\n\n\"On Monday the cage door opens and clangs to upon the victim for another\neleven months and a week,\" answered Jonathan.\n\nLinda swung a little. \"It must be awful,\" she said slowly.\n\n\"Would ye have me laugh, my fair sister? Would ye have me weep?\"\n\nLinda was so accustomed to Jonathan's way of talking that she paid no\nattention to it.\n\n\"I suppose,\" she said vaguely, \"one gets used to it. One gets used to\nanything.\"\n\n\"Does one? Hum!\" The \"Hum\" was so deep it seemed to boom from underneath\nthe ground. \"I wonder how it's done,\" brooded Jonathan; \"I've never\nmanaged it.\"\n\nLooking at him as he lay there, Linda thought again how attractive he\nwas. It was strange to think that he was only an ordinary clerk, that\nStanley earned twice as much money as he. What was the matter with\nJonathan? He had no ambition; she supposed that was it. And yet one felt\nhe was gifted, exceptional. He was passionately fond of music; every\nspare penny he had went on books. He was always full of new ideas,\nschemes, plans. But nothing came of it all. The new fire blazed in\nJonathan; you almost heard it roaring softly as he explained, described\nand dilated on the new thing; but a moment later it had fallen in and\nthere was nothing but ashes, and Jonathan went about with a look like\nhunger in his black eyes. At these times he exaggerated his absurd\nmanner of speaking, and he sang in church--he was the leader of the\nchoir--with such fearful dramatic intensity that the meanest hymn put on\nan unholy splendour.\n\n\"It seems to me just as imbecile, just as infernal, to have to go to the\noffice on Monday,\" said Jonathan, \"as it always has done and always will\ndo. To spend all the best years of one's life sitting on a stool from\nnine to five, scratching in somebody's ledger! It's a queer use to make\nof one's... one and only life, isn't it? Or do I fondly dream?\" He\nrolled over on the grass and looked up at Linda. \"Tell me, what is the\ndifference between my life and that of an ordinary prisoner. The only\ndifference I can see is that I put myself in jail and nobody's ever\ngoing to let me out. That's a more intolerable situation than the other.\nFor if I'd been--pushed in, against my will--kicking, even--once the\ndoor was locked, or at any rate in five years or so, I might have\naccepted the fact and begun to take an interest in the flight of\nflies or counting the warder's steps along the passage with particular\nattention to variations of tread and so on. But as it is, I'm like an\ninsect that's flown into a room of its own accord. I dash against the\nwalls, dash against the windows, flop against the ceiling, do everything\non God's earth, in fact, except fly out again. And all the while I'm\nthinking, like that moth, or that butterfly, or whatever it is, 'The\nshortness of life! The shortness of life!' I've only one night or\none day, and there's this vast dangerous garden, waiting out there,\nundiscovered, unexplored.\"\n\n\"But, if you feel like that, why--\" began Linda quickly.\n\n\"Ah!\" cried Jonathan. And that \"ah!\" was somehow almost exultant.\n\"There you have me. Why? Why indeed? There's the maddening, mysterious\nquestion. Why don't I fly out again? There's the window or the door or\nwhatever it was I came in by. It's not hopelessly shut--is it? Why don't\nI find it and be off? Answer me that, little sister.\" But he gave her no\ntime to answer.\n\n\"I'm exactly like that insect again. For some reason\"--Jonathan paused\nbetween the words--\"it's not allowed, it's forbidden, it's against the\ninsect law, to stop banging and flopping and crawling up the pane even\nfor an instant. Why don't I leave the office? Why don't I seriously\nconsider, this moment, for instance, what it is that prevents me\nleaving? It's not as though I'm tremendously tied. I've two boys to\nprovide for, but, after all, they're boys. I could cut off to sea, or\nget a job up-country, or--\" Suddenly he smiled at Linda and said in\na changed voice, as if he were confiding a secret, \"Weak... weak. No\nstamina. No anchor. No guiding principle, let us call it.\" But then the\ndark velvety voice rolled out:\n\n     \"Would ye hear the story\n      How it unfolds itself... \"\n\nand they were silent.\n\nThe sun had set. In the western sky there were great masses of\ncrushed-up rose-coloured clouds. Broad beams of light shone through the\nclouds and beyond them as if they would cover the whole sky. Overhead\nthe blue faded; it turned a pale gold, and the bush outlined against\nit gleamed dark and brilliant like metal. Sometimes when those beams of\nlight show in the sky they are very awful. They remind you that up there\nsits Jehovah, the jealous God, the Almighty, Whose eye is upon you, ever\nwatchful, never weary. You remember that at His coming the whole earth\nwill shake into one ruined graveyard; the cold, bright angels will drive\nyou this way and that, and there will be no time to explain what could\nbe explained so simply... But to-night it seemed to Linda there was\nsomething infinitely joyful and loving in those silver beams. And now\nno sound came from the sea. It breathed softly as if it would draw that\ntender, joyful beauty into its own bosom.\n\n\"It's all wrong, it's all wrong,\" came the shadowy voice of Jonathan.\n\"It's not the scene, it's not the setting for... three stools, three\ndesks, three inkpots and a wire blind.\"\n\nLinda knew that he would never change, but she said, \"Is it too late,\neven now?\"\n\n\"I'm old--I'm old,\" intoned Jonathan. He bent towards her, he passed his\nhand over his head. \"Look!\" His black hair was speckled all over with\nsilver, like the breast plumage of a black fowl.\n\nLinda was surprised. She had no idea that he was grey. And yet, as he\nstood up beside her and sighed and stretched, she saw him, for the first\ntime, not resolute, not gallant, not careless, but touched already with\nage. He looked very tall on the darkening grass, and the thought crossed\nher mind, \"He is like a weed.\"\n\nJonathan stooped again and kissed her fingers.\n\n\"Heaven reward thy sweet patience, lady mine,\" he murmured. \"I must go\nseek those heirs to my fame and fortune... \" He was gone.\n\n\nChapter 1.XI.\n\nLight shone in the windows of the bungalow. Two square patches of gold\nfell upon the pinks and the peaked marigolds. Florrie, the cat, came\nout on to the veranda, and sat on the top step, her white paws close\ntogether, her tail curled round. She looked content, as though she had\nbeen waiting for this moment all day.\n\n\"Thank goodness, it's getting late,\" said Florrie. \"Thank goodness, the\nlong day is over.\" Her greengage eyes opened.\n\nPresently there sounded the rumble of the coach, the crack of Kelly's\nwhip. It came near enough for one to hear the voices of the men from\ntown, talking loudly together. It stopped at the Burnells' gate.\n\nStanley was half-way up the path before he saw Linda. \"Is that you,\ndarling?\"\n\n\"Yes, Stanley.\"\n\nHe leapt across the flower-bed and seized her in his arms. She was\nenfolded in that familiar, eager, strong embrace.\n\n\"Forgive me, darling, forgive me,\" stammered Stanley, and he put his\nhand under her chin and lifted her face to him.\n\n\"Forgive you?\" smiled Linda. \"But whatever for?\"\n\n\"Good God! You can't have forgotten,\" cried Stanley Burnell. \"I've\nthought of nothing else all day. I've had the hell of a day. I made up\nmy mind to dash out and telegraph, and then I thought the wire mightn't\nreach you before I did. I've been in tortures, Linda.\"\n\n\"But, Stanley,\" said Linda, \"what must I forgive you for?\"\n\n\"Linda!\"--Stanley was very hurt--\"didn't you realize--you must have\nrealized--I went away without saying good-bye to you this morning? I\ncan't imagine how I can have done such a thing. My confounded temper, of\ncourse. But--well\"--and he sighed and took her in his arms again--\"I've\nsuffered for it enough to-day.\"\n\n\"What's that you've got in your hand?\" asked Linda. \"New gloves? Let me\nsee.\"\n\n\"Oh, just a cheap pair of wash-leather ones,\" said Stanley humbly. \"I\nnoticed Bell was wearing some in the coach this morning, so, as I\nwas passing the shop, I dashed in and got myself a pair. What are you\nsmiling at? You don't think it was wrong of me, do you?\"\n\n\"On the con-trary, darling,\" said Linda, \"I think it was most sensible.\"\n\nShe pulled one of the large, pale gloves on her own fingers and looked\nat her hand, turning it this way and that. She was still smiling.\n\nStanley wanted to say, \"I was thinking of you the whole time I bought\nthem.\" It was true, but for some reason he couldn't say it. \"Let's go\nin,\" said he.\n\n\nChapter 1.XII.\n\nWhy does one feel so different at night? Why is it so exciting to be\nawake when everybody else is asleep? Late--it is very late! And yet\nevery moment you feel more and more wakeful, as though you were slowly,\nalmost with every breath, waking up into a new, wonderful, far more\nthrilling and exciting world than the daylight one. And what is this\nqueer sensation that you're a conspirator? Lightly, stealthily you move\nabout your room. You take something off the dressing-table and put it\ndown again without a sound. And everything, even the bed-post, knows\nyou, responds, shares your secret...\n\nYou're not very fond of your room by day. You never think about it.\nYou're in and out, the door opens and slams, the cupboard creaks. You\nsit down on the side of your bed, change your shoes and dash out again.\nA dive down to the glass, two pins in your hair, powder your nose and\noff again. But now--it's suddenly dear to you. It's a darling little\nfunny room. It's yours. Oh, what a joy it is to own things! Mine--my\nown!\n\n\"My very own for ever?\"\n\n\"Yes.\" Their lips met.\n\nNo, of course, that had nothing to do with it. That was all nonsense\nand rubbish. But, in spite of herself, Beryl saw so plainly two people\nstanding in the middle of her room. Her arms were round his neck; he\nheld her. And now he whispered, \"My beauty, my little beauty!\"\nShe jumped off her bed, ran over to the window and kneeled on the\nwindow-seat, with her elbows on the sill. But the beautiful night, the\ngarden, every bush, every leaf, even the white palings, even the stars,\nwere conspirators too. So bright was the moon that the flowers were\nbright as by day; the shadow of the nasturtiums, exquisite lily-like\nleaves and wide-open flowers, lay across the silvery veranda. The\nmanuka-tree, bent by the southerly winds, was like a bird on one leg\nstretching out a wing.\n\nBut when Beryl looked at the bush, it seemed to her the bush was sad.\n\n\"We are dumb trees, reaching up in the night, imploring we know not\nwhat,\" said the sorrowful bush.\n\nIt is true when you are by yourself and you think about life, it is\nalways sad. All that excitement and so on has a way of suddenly leaving\nyou, and it's as though, in the silence, somebody called your name, and\nyou heard your name for the first time. \"Beryl!\"\n\n\"Yes, I'm here. I'm Beryl. Who wants me?\"\n\n\"Beryl!\"\n\n\"Let me come.\"\n\nIt is lonely living by oneself. Of course, there are relations, friends,\nheaps of them; but that's not what she means. She wants some one who\nwill find the Beryl they none of them know, who will expect her to be\nthat Beryl always. She wants a lover.\n\n\"Take me away from all these other people, my love. Let us go far away.\nLet us live our life, all new, all ours, from the very beginning. Let us\nmake our fire. Let us sit down to eat together. Let us have long talks\nat night.\"\n\nAnd the thought was almost, \"Save me, my love. Save me!\"\n\n... \"Oh, go on! Don't be a prude, my dear. You enjoy yourself while\nyou're young. That's my advice.\" And a high rush of silly laughter\njoined Mrs. Harry Kember's loud, indifferent neigh.\n\nYou see, it's so frightfully difficult when you've nobody. You're so\nat the mercy of things. You can't just be rude. And you've always this\nhorror of seeming inexperienced and stuffy like the other ninnies at the\nBay. And--and it's fascinating to know you've power over people. Yes,\nthat is fascinating...\n\nOh why, oh why doesn't \"he\" come soon?\n\nIf I go on living here, thought Beryl, anything may happen to me.\n\n\"But how do you know he is coming at all?\" mocked a small voice within\nher.\n\nBut Beryl dismissed it. She couldn't be left. Other people, perhaps, but\nnot she. It wasn't possible to think that Beryl Fairfield never married,\nthat lovely fascinating girl.\n\n\"Do you remember Beryl Fairfield?\"\n\n\"Remember her! As if I could forget her! It was one summer at the\nBay that I saw her. She was standing on the beach in a blue\"--no,\npink--\"muslin frock, holding on a big cream\"--no, black--\"straw hat. But\nit's years ago now.\"\n\n\"She's as lovely as ever, more so if anything.\"\n\nBeryl smiled, bit her lip, and gazed over the garden. As she gazed, she\nsaw somebody, a man, leave the road, step along the paddock beside their\npalings as if he was coming straight towards her. Her heart beat. Who\nwas it? Who could it be? It couldn't be a burglar, certainly not a\nburglar, for he was smoking and he strolled lightly. Beryl's heart\nleapt; it seemed to turn right over, and then to stop. She recognized\nhim.\n\n\"Good evening, Miss Beryl,\" said the voice softly.\n\n\"Good evening.\"\n\n\"Won't you come for a little walk?\" it drawled.\n\nCome for a walk--at that time of night! \"I couldn't. Everybody's in bed.\nEverybody's asleep.\"\n\n\"Oh,\" said the voice lightly, and a whiff of sweet smoke reached her.\n\"What does everybody matter? Do come! It's such a fine night. There's\nnot a soul about.\"\n\nBeryl shook her head. But already something stirred in her, something\nreared its head.\n\nThe voice said, \"Frightened?\" It mocked, \"Poor little girl!\"\n\n\"Not in the least,\" said she. As she spoke that weak thing within her\nseemed to uncoil, to grow suddenly tremendously strong; she longed to\ngo!\n\nAnd just as if this was quite understood by the other, the voice said,\ngently and softly, but finally, \"Come along!\"\n\nBeryl stepped over her low window, crossed the veranda, ran down the\ngrass to the gate. He was there before her.\n\n\"That's right,\" breathed the voice, and it teased, \"You're not\nfrightened, are you? You're not frightened?\"\n\nShe was; now she was here she was terrified, and it seemed to her\neverything was different. The moonlight stared and glittered; the\nshadows were like bars of iron. Her hand was taken.\n\n\"Not in the least,\" she said lightly. \"Why should I be?\"\n\nHer hand was pulled gently, tugged. She held back.\n\n\"No, I'm not coming any farther,\" said Beryl.\n\n\"Oh, rot!\" Harry Kember didn't believe her. \"Come along! We'll just go\nas far as that fuchsia bush. Come along!\"\n\nThe fuchsia bush was tall. It fell over the fence in a shower. There was\na little pit of darkness beneath.\n\n\"No, really, I don't want to,\" said Beryl.\n\nFor a moment Harry Kember didn't answer. Then he came close to her,\nturned to her, smiled and said quickly, \"Don't be silly! Don't be\nsilly!\"\n\nHis smile was something she'd never seen before. Was he drunk? That\nbright, blind, terrifying smile froze her with horror. What was she\ndoing? How had she got here? the stern garden asked her as the gate\npushed open, and quick as a cat Harry Kember came through and snatched\nher to him.\n\n\"Cold little devil! Cold little devil!\" said the hateful voice.\n\nBut Beryl was strong. She slipped, ducked, wrenched free.\n\n\"You are vile, vile,\" said she.\n\n\"Then why in God's name did you come?\" stammered Harry Kember.\n\nNobody answered him.\n\n\nChapter 1.XIII.\n\nA cloud, small, serene, floated across the moon. In that moment of\ndarkness the sea sounded deep, troubled. Then the cloud sailed away,\nand the sound of the sea was a vague murmur, as though it waked out of a\ndark dream. All was still.\n\n\n\n\n</CHAPTER>\n"}, {"id": 2, "text": "<CHAPTER>\n2. THE GARDEN PARTY.\n\nAnd after all the weather was ideal. They could not have had a more\nperfect day for a garden-party if they had ordered it. Windless, warm,\nthe sky without a cloud. Only the blue was veiled with a haze of light\ngold, as it is sometimes in early summer. The gardener had been up since\ndawn, mowing the lawns and sweeping them, until the grass and the dark\nflat rosettes where the daisy plants had been seemed to shine. As for\nthe roses, you could not help feeling they understood that roses are\nthe only flowers that impress people at garden-parties; the only flowers\nthat everybody is certain of knowing. Hundreds, yes, literally hundreds,\nhad come out in a single night; the green bushes bowed down as though\nthey had been visited by archangels.\n\nBreakfast was not yet over before the men came to put up the marquee.\n\n\"Where do you want the marquee put, mother?\"\n\n\"My dear child, it's no use asking me. I'm determined to leave\neverything to you children this year. Forget I am your mother. Treat me\nas an honoured guest.\"\n\nBut Meg could not possibly go and supervise the men. She had washed\nher hair before breakfast, and she sat drinking her coffee in a green\nturban, with a dark wet curl stamped on each cheek. Jose, the butterfly,\nalways came down in a silk petticoat and a kimono jacket.\n\n\"You'll have to go, Laura; you're the artistic one.\"\n\nAway Laura flew, still holding her piece of bread-and-butter. It's so\ndelicious to have an excuse for eating out of doors, and besides, she\nloved having to arrange things; she always felt she could do it so much\nbetter than anybody else.\n\nFour men in their shirt-sleeves stood grouped together on the garden\npath. They carried staves covered with rolls of canvas, and they had big\ntool-bags slung on their backs. They looked impressive. Laura wished now\nthat she had not got the bread-and-butter, but there was nowhere to put\nit, and she couldn't possibly throw it away. She blushed and tried to\nlook severe and even a little bit short-sighted as she came up to them.\n\n\"Good morning,\" she said, copying her mother's voice. But that sounded\nso fearfully affected that she was ashamed, and stammered like a little\ngirl, \"Oh--er--have you come--is it about the marquee?\"\n\n\"That's right, miss,\" said the tallest of the men, a lanky, freckled\nfellow, and he shifted his tool-bag, knocked back his straw hat and\nsmiled down at her. \"That's about it.\"\n\nHis smile was so easy, so friendly that Laura recovered. What nice eyes\nhe had, small, but such a dark blue! And now she looked at the others,\nthey were smiling too. \"Cheer up, we won't bite,\" their smile seemed\nto say. How very nice workmen were! And what a beautiful morning! She\nmustn't mention the morning; she must be business-like. The marquee.\n\n\"Well, what about the lily-lawn? Would that do?\"\n\nAnd she pointed to the lily-lawn with the hand that didn't hold the\nbread-and-butter. They turned, they stared in the direction. A little\nfat chap thrust out his under-lip, and the tall fellow frowned.\n\n\"I don't fancy it,\" said he. \"Not conspicuous enough. You see, with a\nthing like a marquee,\" and he turned to Laura in his easy way, \"you want\nto put it somewhere where it'll give you a bang slap in the eye, if you\nfollow me.\"\n\nLaura's upbringing made her wonder for a moment whether it was quite\nrespectful of a workman to talk to her of bangs slap in the eye. But she\ndid quite follow him.\n\n\"A corner of the tennis-court,\" she suggested. \"But the band's going to\nbe in one corner.\"\n\n\"H'm, going to have a band, are you?\" said another of the workmen.\nHe was pale. He had a haggard look as his dark eyes scanned the\ntennis-court. What was he thinking?\n\n\"Only a very small band,\" said Laura gently. Perhaps he wouldn't mind so\nmuch if the band was quite small. But the tall fellow interrupted.\n\n\"Look here, miss, that's the place. Against those trees. Over there.\nThat'll do fine.\"\n\nAgainst the karakas. Then the karaka-trees would be hidden. And they\nwere so lovely, with their broad, gleaming leaves, and their clusters\nof yellow fruit. They were like trees you imagined growing on a desert\nisland, proud, solitary, lifting their leaves and fruits to the sun in a\nkind of silent splendour. Must they be hidden by a marquee?\n\nThey must. Already the men had shouldered their staves and were making\nfor the place. Only the tall fellow was left. He bent down, pinched a\nsprig of lavender, put his thumb and forefinger to his nose and snuffed\nup the smell. When Laura saw that gesture she forgot all about the\nkarakas in her wonder at him caring for things like that--caring for\nthe smell of lavender. How many men that she knew would have done such\na thing? Oh, how extraordinarily nice workmen were, she thought. Why\ncouldn't she have workmen for her friends rather than the silly boys she\ndanced with and who came to Sunday night supper? She would get on much\nbetter with men like these.\n\nIt's all the fault, she decided, as the tall fellow drew something on\nthe back of an envelope, something that was to be looped up or left to\nhang, of these absurd class distinctions. Well, for her part, she didn't\nfeel them. Not a bit, not an atom... And now there came the chock-chock\nof wooden hammers. Some one whistled, some one sang out, \"Are you right\nthere, matey?\" \"Matey!\" The friendliness of it, the--the--Just to prove\nhow happy she was, just to show the tall fellow how at home she felt,\nand how she despised stupid conventions, Laura took a big bite of her\nbread-and-butter as she stared at the little drawing. She felt just like\na work-girl.\n\n\"Laura, Laura, where are you? Telephone, Laura!\" a voice cried from the\nhouse.\n\n\"Coming!\" Away she skimmed, over the lawn, up the path, up the steps,\nacross the veranda, and into the porch. In the hall her father and\nLaurie were brushing their hats ready to go to the office.\n\n\"I say, Laura,\" said Laurie very fast, \"you might just give a squiz at\nmy coat before this afternoon. See if it wants pressing.\"\n\n\"I will,\" said she. Suddenly she couldn't stop herself. She ran at\nLaurie and gave him a small, quick squeeze. \"Oh, I do love parties,\ndon't you?\" gasped Laura.\n\n\"Ra-ther,\" said Laurie's warm, boyish voice, and he squeezed his sister\ntoo, and gave her a gentle push. \"Dash off to the telephone, old girl.\"\n\nThe telephone. \"Yes, yes; oh yes. Kitty? Good morning, dear. Come to\nlunch? Do, dear. Delighted of course. It will only be a very scratch\nmeal--just the sandwich crusts and broken meringue-shells and what's\nleft over. Yes, isn't it a perfect morning? Your white? Oh, I certainly\nshould. One moment--hold the line. Mother's calling.\" And Laura sat\nback. \"What, mother? Can't hear.\"\n\nMrs. Sheridan's voice floated down the stairs. \"Tell her to wear that\nsweet hat she had on last Sunday.\"\n\n\"Mother says you're to wear that sweet hat you had on last Sunday. Good.\nOne o'clock. Bye-bye.\"\n\nLaura put back the receiver, flung her arms over her head, took a deep\nbreath, stretched and let them fall. \"Huh,\" she sighed, and the moment\nafter the sigh she sat up quickly. She was still, listening. All the\ndoors in the house seemed to be open. The house was alive with soft,\nquick steps and running voices. The green baize door that led to the\nkitchen regions swung open and shut with a muffled thud. And now there\ncame a long, chuckling absurd sound. It was the heavy piano being moved\non its stiff castors. But the air! If you stopped to notice, was the air\nalways like this? Little faint winds were playing chase, in at the tops\nof the windows, out at the doors. And there were two tiny spots of\nsun, one on the inkpot, one on a silver photograph frame, playing too.\nDarling little spots. Especially the one on the inkpot lid. It was quite\nwarm. A warm little silver star. She could have kissed it.\n\nThe front door bell pealed, and there sounded the rustle of Sadie's\nprint skirt on the stairs. A man's voice murmured; Sadie answered,\ncareless, \"I'm sure I don't know. Wait. I'll ask Mrs Sheridan.\"\n\n\"What is it, Sadie?\" Laura came into the hall.\n\n\"It's the florist, Miss Laura.\"\n\nIt was, indeed. There, just inside the door, stood a wide, shallow tray\nfull of pots of pink lilies. No other kind. Nothing but lilies--canna\nlilies, big pink flowers, wide open, radiant, almost frighteningly alive\non bright crimson stems.\n\n\"O-oh, Sadie!\" said Laura, and the sound was like a little moan. She\ncrouched down as if to warm herself at that blaze of lilies; she felt\nthey were in her fingers, on her lips, growing in her breast.\n\n\"It's some mistake,\" she said faintly. \"Nobody ever ordered so many.\nSadie, go and find mother.\"\n\nBut at that moment Mrs. Sheridan joined them.\n\n\"It's quite right,\" she said calmly. \"Yes, I ordered them. Aren't they\nlovely?\" She pressed Laura's arm. \"I was passing the shop yesterday, and\nI saw them in the window. And I suddenly thought for once in my life I\nshall have enough canna lilies. The garden-party will be a good excuse.\"\n\n\"But I thought you said you didn't mean to interfere,\" said Laura. Sadie\nhad gone. The florist's man was still outside at his van. She put\nher arm round her mother's neck and gently, very gently, she bit her\nmother's ear.\n\n\"My darling child, you wouldn't like a logical mother, would you? Don't\ndo that. Here's the man.\"\n\nHe carried more lilies still, another whole tray.\n\n\"Bank them up, just inside the door, on both sides of the porch,\nplease,\" said Mrs. Sheridan. \"Don't you agree, Laura?\"\n\n\"Oh, I do, mother.\"\n\nIn the drawing-room Meg, Jose and good little Hans had at last succeeded\nin moving the piano.\n\n\"Now, if we put this chesterfield against the wall and move everything\nout of the room except the chairs, don't you think?\"\n\n\"Quite.\"\n\n\"Hans, move these tables into the smoking-room, and bring a sweeper\nto take these marks off the carpet and--one moment, Hans--\" Jose loved\ngiving orders to the servants, and they loved obeying her. She always\nmade them feel they were taking part in some drama. \"Tell mother and\nMiss Laura to come here at once.\n\n\"Very good, Miss Jose.\"\n\nShe turned to Meg. \"I want to hear what the piano sounds like, just\nin case I'm asked to sing this afternoon. Let's try over 'This life is\nWeary.'\"\n\nPom! Ta-ta-ta Tee-ta! The piano burst out so passionately that\nJose's face changed. She clasped her hands. She looked mournfully and\nenigmatically at her mother and Laura as they came in.\n\n     \"This Life is Wee-ary,\n      A Tear--a Sigh.\n      A Love that Chan-ges,\n        This Life is Wee-ary,\n      A Tear--a Sigh.\n      A Love that Chan-ges,\n      And then... Good-bye!\"\n\nBut at the word \"Good-bye,\" and although the piano sounded more\ndesperate than ever, her face broke into a brilliant, dreadfully\nunsympathetic smile.\n\n\"Aren't I in good voice, mummy?\" she beamed.\n\n     \"This Life is Wee-ary,\n      Hope comes to Die.\n      A Dream--a Wa-kening.\"\n\nBut now Sadie interrupted them. \"What is it, Sadie?\"\n\n\"If you please, m'm, cook says have you got the flags for the\nsandwiches?\"\n\n\"The flags for the sandwiches, Sadie?\" echoed Mrs. Sheridan dreamily.\nAnd the children knew by her face that she hadn't got them. \"Let me\nsee.\" And she said to Sadie firmly, \"Tell cook I'll let her have them in\nten minutes.\"\n\nSadie went.\n\n\"Now, Laura,\" said her mother quickly, \"come with me into the\nsmoking-room. I've got the names somewhere on the back of an envelope.\nYou'll have to write them out for me. Meg, go upstairs this minute and\ntake that wet thing off your head. Jose, run and finish dressing this\ninstant. Do you hear me, children, or shall I have to tell your father\nwhen he comes home to-night? And--and, Jose, pacify cook if you do go\ninto the kitchen, will you? I'm terrified of her this morning.\"\n\nThe envelope was found at last behind the dining-room clock, though how\nit had got there Mrs. Sheridan could not imagine.\n\n\"One of you children must have stolen it out of my bag, because I\nremember vividly--cream cheese and lemon-curd. Have you done that?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"Egg and--\" Mrs. Sheridan held the envelope away from her. \"It looks\nlike mice. It can't be mice, can it?\"\n\n\"Olive, pet,\" said Laura, looking over her shoulder.\n\n\"Yes, of course, olive. What a horrible combination it sounds. Egg and\nolive.\"\n\nThey were finished at last, and Laura took them off to the kitchen. She\nfound Jose there pacifying the cook, who did not look at all terrifying.\n\n\"I have never seen such exquisite sandwiches,\" said Jose's rapturous\nvoice. \"How many kinds did you say there were, cook? Fifteen?\"\n\n\"Fifteen, Miss Jose.\"\n\n\"Well, cook, I congratulate you.\"\n\nCook swept up crusts with the long sandwich knife, and smiled broadly.\n\n\"Godber's has come,\" announced Sadie, issuing out of the pantry. She had\nseen the man pass the window.\n\nThat meant the cream puffs had come. Godber's were famous for their\ncream puffs. Nobody ever thought of making them at home.\n\n\"Bring them in and put them on the table, my girl,\" ordered cook.\n\nSadie brought them in and went back to the door. Of course Laura and\nJose were far too grown-up to really care about such things. All the\nsame, they couldn't help agreeing that the puffs looked very attractive.\nVery. Cook began arranging them, shaking off the extra icing sugar.\n\n\"Don't they carry one back to all one's parties?\" said Laura.\n\n\"I suppose they do,\" said practical Jose, who never liked to be carried\nback. \"They look beautifully light and feathery, I must say.\"\n\n\"Have one each, my dears,\" said cook in her comfortable voice. \"Yer ma\nwon't know.\"\n\nOh, impossible. Fancy cream puffs so soon after breakfast. The very idea\nmade one shudder. All the same, two minutes later Jose and Laura were\nlicking their fingers with that absorbed inward look that only comes\nfrom whipped cream.\n\n\"Let's go into the garden, out by the back way,\" suggested Laura. \"I\nwant to see how the men are getting on with the marquee. They're such\nawfully nice men.\"\n\nBut the back door was blocked by cook, Sadie, Godber's man and Hans.\n\nSomething had happened.\n\n\"Tuk-tuk-tuk,\" clucked cook like an agitated hen. Sadie had her hand\nclapped to her cheek as though she had toothache. Hans's face was\nscrewed up in the effort to understand. Only Godber's man seemed to be\nenjoying himself; it was his story.\n\n\"What's the matter? What's happened?\"\n\n\"There's been a horrible accident,\" said Cook. \"A man killed.\"\n\n\"A man killed! Where? How? When?\"\n\nBut Godber's man wasn't going to have his story snatched from under his\nvery nose.\n\n\"Know those little cottages just below here, miss?\" Know them? Of\ncourse, she knew them. \"Well, there's a young chap living there, name of\nScott, a carter. His horse shied at a traction-engine, corner of Hawke\nStreet this morning, and he was thrown out on the back of his head.\nKilled.\"\n\n\"Dead!\" Laura stared at Godber's man.\n\n\"Dead when they picked him up,\" said Godber's man with relish. \"They\nwere taking the body home as I come up here.\" And he said to the cook,\n\"He's left a wife and five little ones.\"\n\n\"Jose, come here.\" Laura caught hold of her sister's sleeve and dragged\nher through the kitchen to the other side of the green baize door. There\nshe paused and leaned against it. \"Jose!\" she said, horrified, \"however\nare we going to stop everything?\"\n\n\"Stop everything, Laura!\" cried Jose in astonishment. \"What do you\nmean?\"\n\n\"Stop the garden-party, of course.\" Why did Jose pretend?\n\nBut Jose was still more amazed. \"Stop the garden-party? My dear Laura,\ndon't be so absurd. Of course we can't do anything of the kind. Nobody\nexpects us to. Don't be so extravagant.\"\n\n\"But we can't possibly have a garden-party with a man dead just outside\nthe front gate.\"\n\nThat really was extravagant, for the little cottages were in a lane to\nthemselves at the very bottom of a steep rise that led up to the house.\nA broad road ran between. True, they were far too near. They were\nthe greatest possible eyesore, and they had no right to be in that\nneighbourhood at all. They were little mean dwellings painted a\nchocolate brown. In the garden patches there was nothing but cabbage\nstalks, sick hens and tomato cans. The very smoke coming out of their\nchimneys was poverty-stricken. Little rags and shreds of smoke, so\nunlike the great silvery plumes that uncurled from the Sheridans'\nchimneys. Washerwomen lived in the lane and sweeps and a cobbler, and\na man whose house-front was studded all over with minute bird-cages.\nChildren swarmed. When the Sheridans were little they were forbidden to\nset foot there because of the revolting language and of what they might\ncatch. But since they were grown up, Laura and Laurie on their prowls\nsometimes walked through. It was disgusting and sordid. They came\nout with a shudder. But still one must go everywhere; one must see\neverything. So through they went.\n\n\"And just think of what the band would sound like to that poor woman,\"\nsaid Laura.\n\n\"Oh, Laura!\" Jose began to be seriously annoyed. \"If you're going to\nstop a band playing every time some one has an accident, you'll lead a\nvery strenuous life. I'm every bit as sorry about it as you. I feel just\nas sympathetic.\" Her eyes hardened. She looked at her sister just as she\nused to when they were little and fighting together. \"You won't bring a\ndrunken workman back to life by being sentimental,\" she said softly.\n\n\"Drunk! Who said he was drunk?\" Laura turned furiously on Jose. She\nsaid, just as they had used to say on those occasions, \"I'm going\nstraight up to tell mother.\"\n\n\"Do, dear,\" cooed Jose.\n\n\"Mother, can I come into your room?\" Laura turned the big glass\ndoor-knob.\n\n\"Of course, child. Why, what's the matter? What's given you such a\ncolour?\" And Mrs. Sheridan turned round from her dressing-table. She was\ntrying on a new hat.\n\n\"Mother, a man's been killed,\" began Laura.\n\n\"Not in the garden?\" interrupted her mother.\n\n\"No, no!\"\n\n\"Oh, what a fright you gave me!\" Mrs. Sheridan sighed with relief, and\ntook off the big hat and held it on her knees.\n\n\"But listen, mother,\" said Laura. Breathless, half-choking, she told\nthe dreadful story. \"Of course, we can't have our party, can we?\" she\npleaded. \"The band and everybody arriving. They'd hear us, mother;\nthey're nearly neighbours!\"\n\nTo Laura's astonishment her mother behaved just like Jose; it was harder\nto bear because she seemed amused. She refused to take Laura seriously.\n\n\"But, my dear child, use your common sense. It's only by accident we've\nheard of it. If some one had died there normally--and I can't understand\nhow they keep alive in those poky little holes--we should still be\nhaving our party, shouldn't we?\"\n\nLaura had to say \"yes\" to that, but she felt it was all wrong. She sat\ndown on her mother's sofa and pinched the cushion frill.\n\n\"Mother, isn't it terribly heartless of us?\" she asked.\n\n\"Darling!\" Mrs. Sheridan got up and came over to her, carrying the hat.\nBefore Laura could stop her she had popped it on. \"My child!\" said her\nmother, \"the hat is yours. It's made for you. It's much too young for\nme. I have never seen you look such a picture. Look at yourself!\" And\nshe held up her hand-mirror.\n\n\"But, mother,\" Laura began again. She couldn't look at herself; she\nturned aside.\n\nThis time Mrs. Sheridan lost patience just as Jose had done.\n\n\"You are being very absurd, Laura,\" she said coldly. \"People like that\ndon't expect sacrifices from us. And it's not very sympathetic to spoil\neverybody's enjoyment as you're doing now.\"\n\n\"I don't understand,\" said Laura, and she walked quickly out of the room\ninto her own bedroom. There, quite by chance, the first thing she saw\nwas this charming girl in the mirror, in her black hat trimmed with\ngold daisies, and a long black velvet ribbon. Never had she imagined she\ncould look like that. Is mother right? she thought. And now she\nhoped her mother was right. Am I being extravagant? Perhaps it was\nextravagant. Just for a moment she had another glimpse of that poor\nwoman and those little children, and the body being carried into\nthe house. But it all seemed blurred, unreal, like a picture in the\nnewspaper. I'll remember it again after the party's over, she decided.\nAnd somehow that seemed quite the best plan...\n\nLunch was over by half-past one. By half-past two they were all ready\nfor the fray. The green-coated band had arrived and was established in a\ncorner of the tennis-court.\n\n\"My dear!\" trilled Kitty Maitland, \"aren't they too like frogs for\nwords? You ought to have arranged them round the pond with the conductor\nin the middle on a leaf.\"\n\nLaurie arrived and hailed them on his way to dress. At the sight of him\nLaura remembered the accident again. She wanted to tell him. If Laurie\nagreed with the others, then it was bound to be all right. And she\nfollowed him into the hall.\n\n\"Laurie!\"\n\n\"Hallo!\" He was half-way upstairs, but when he turned round and saw\nLaura he suddenly puffed out his cheeks and goggled his eyes at her.\n\"My word, Laura! You do look stunning,\" said Laurie. \"What an absolutely\ntopping hat!\"\n\nLaura said faintly \"Is it?\" and smiled up at Laurie, and didn't tell him\nafter all.\n\nSoon after that people began coming in streams. The band struck up; the\nhired waiters ran from the house to the marquee. Wherever you looked\nthere were couples strolling, bending to the flowers, greeting, moving\non over the lawn. They were like bright birds that had alighted in the\nSheridans' garden for this one afternoon, on their way to--where? Ah,\nwhat happiness it is to be with people who all are happy, to press\nhands, press cheeks, smile into eyes.\n\n\"Darling Laura, how well you look!\"\n\n\"What a becoming hat, child!\"\n\n\"Laura, you look quite Spanish. I've never seen you look so striking.\"\n\nAnd Laura, glowing, answered softly, \"Have you had tea? Won't you have\nan ice? The passion-fruit ices really are rather special.\" She ran to\nher father and begged him. \"Daddy darling, can't the band have something\nto drink?\"\n\nAnd the perfect afternoon slowly ripened, slowly faded, slowly its\npetals closed.\n\n\"Never a more delightful garden-party... \" \"The greatest success... \"\n\"Quite the most... \"\n\nLaura helped her mother with the good-byes. They stood side by side in\nthe porch till it was all over.\n\n\"All over, all over, thank heaven,\" said Mrs. Sheridan. \"Round up the\nothers, Laura. Let's go and have some fresh coffee. I'm exhausted. Yes,\nit's been very successful. But oh, these parties, these parties! Why\nwill you children insist on giving parties!\" And they all of them sat\ndown in the deserted marquee.\n\n\"Have a sandwich, daddy dear. I wrote the flag.\"\n\n\"Thanks.\" Mr. Sheridan took a bite and the sandwich was gone. He took\nanother. \"I suppose you didn't hear of a beastly accident that happened\nto-day?\" he said.\n\n\"My dear,\" said Mrs. Sheridan, holding up her hand, \"we did. It nearly\nruined the party. Laura insisted we should put it off.\"\n\n\"Oh, mother!\" Laura didn't want to be teased about it.\n\n\"It was a horrible affair all the same,\" said Mr. Sheridan. \"The chap\nwas married too. Lived just below in the lane, and leaves a wife and\nhalf a dozen kiddies, so they say.\"\n\nAn awkward little silence fell. Mrs. Sheridan fidgeted with her cup.\nReally, it was very tactless of father...\n\nSuddenly she looked up. There on the table were all those sandwiches,\ncakes, puffs, all uneaten, all going to be wasted. She had one of her\nbrilliant ideas.\n\n\"I know,\" she said. \"Let's make up a basket. Let's send that poor\ncreature some of this perfectly good food. At any rate, it will be the\ngreatest treat for the children. Don't you agree? And she's sure to\nhave neighbours calling in and so on. What a point to have it all ready\nprepared. Laura!\" She jumped up. \"Get me the big basket out of the\nstairs cupboard.\"\n\n\"But, mother, do you really think it's a good idea?\" said Laura.\n\nAgain, how curious, she seemed to be different from them all. To take\nscraps from their party. Would the poor woman really like that?\n\n\"Of course! What's the matter with you to-day? An hour or two ago you\nwere insisting on us being sympathetic, and now--\"\n\nOh well! Laura ran for the basket. It was filled, it was heaped by her\nmother.\n\n\"Take it yourself, darling,\" said she. \"Run down just as you are. No,\nwait, take the arum lilies too. People of that class are so impressed by\narum lilies.\"\n\n\"The stems will ruin her lace frock,\" said practical Jose.\n\nSo they would. Just in time. \"Only the basket, then. And, Laura!\"--her\nmother followed her out of the marquee--\"don't on any account--\"\n\n\"What mother?\"\n\nNo, better not put such ideas into the child's head! \"Nothing! Run\nalong.\"\n\nIt was just growing dusky as Laura shut their garden gates. A big dog\nran by like a shadow. The road gleamed white, and down below in the\nhollow the little cottages were in deep shade. How quiet it seemed after\nthe afternoon. Here she was going down the hill to somewhere where a man\nlay dead, and she couldn't realize it. Why couldn't she? She stopped\na minute. And it seemed to her that kisses, voices, tinkling spoons,\nlaughter, the smell of crushed grass were somehow inside her. She had no\nroom for anything else. How strange! She looked up at the pale sky, and\nall she thought was, \"Yes, it was the most successful party.\"\n\nNow the broad road was crossed. The lane began, smoky and dark. Women in\nshawls and men's tweed caps hurried by. Men hung over the palings; the\nchildren played in the doorways. A low hum came from the mean little\ncottages. In some of them there was a flicker of light, and a shadow,\ncrab-like, moved across the window. Laura bent her head and hurried on.\nShe wished now she had put on a coat. How her frock shone! And the\nbig hat with the velvet streamer--if only it was another hat! Were the\npeople looking at her? They must be. It was a mistake to have come; she\nknew all along it was a mistake. Should she go back even now?\n\nNo, too late. This was the house. It must be. A dark knot of people\nstood outside. Beside the gate an old, old woman with a crutch sat in a\nchair, watching. She had her feet on a newspaper. The voices stopped as\nLaura drew near. The group parted. It was as though she was expected, as\nthough they had known she was coming here.\n\nLaura was terribly nervous. Tossing the velvet ribbon over her shoulder,\nshe said to a woman standing by, \"Is this Mrs. Scott's house?\" and the\nwoman, smiling queerly, said, \"It is, my lass.\"\n\nOh, to be away from this! She actually said, \"Help me, God,\" as she\nwalked up the tiny path and knocked. To be away from those staring eyes,\nor to be covered up in anything, one of those women's shawls even. I'll\njust leave the basket and go, she decided. I shan't even wait for it to\nbe emptied.\n\nThen the door opened. A little woman in black showed in the gloom.\n\nLaura said, \"Are you Mrs. Scott?\" But to her horror the woman answered,\n\"Walk in please, miss,\" and she was shut in the passage.\n\n\"No,\" said Laura, \"I don't want to come in. I only want to leave this\nbasket. Mother sent--\"\n\nThe little woman in the gloomy passage seemed not to have heard her.\n\"Step this way, please, miss,\" she said in an oily voice, and Laura\nfollowed her.\n\nShe found herself in a wretched little low kitchen, lighted by a smoky\nlamp. There was a woman sitting before the fire.\n\n\"Em,\" said the little creature who had let her in. \"Em! It's a young\nlady.\" She turned to Laura. She said meaningly, \"I'm 'er sister, miss.\nYou'll excuse 'er, won't you?\"\n\n\"Oh, but of course!\" said Laura. \"Please, please don't disturb her. I--I\nonly want to leave--\"\n\nBut at that moment the woman at the fire turned round. Her face, puffed\nup, red, with swollen eyes and swollen lips, looked terrible. She seemed\nas though she couldn't understand why Laura was there. What did it mean?\nWhy was this stranger standing in the kitchen with a basket? What was it\nall about? And the poor face puckered up again.\n\n\"All right, my dear,\" said the other. \"I'll thenk the young lady.\"\n\nAnd again she began, \"You'll excuse her, miss, I'm sure,\" and her face,\nswollen too, tried an oily smile.\n\nLaura only wanted to get out, to get away. She was back in the passage.\nThe door opened. She walked straight through into the bedroom, where the\ndead man was lying.\n\n\"You'd like a look at 'im, wouldn't you?\" said Em's sister, and she\nbrushed past Laura over to the bed. \"Don't be afraid, my lass,\"--and now\nher voice sounded fond and sly, and fondly she drew down the sheet--\"'e\nlooks a picture. There's nothing to show. Come along, my dear.\"\n\nLaura came.\n\nThere lay a young man, fast asleep--sleeping so soundly, so deeply, that\nhe was far, far away from them both. Oh, so remote, so peaceful. He was\ndreaming. Never wake him up again. His head was sunk in the pillow, his\neyes were closed; they were blind under the closed eyelids. He was given\nup to his dream. What did garden-parties and baskets and lace frocks\nmatter to him? He was far from all those things. He was wonderful,\nbeautiful. While they were laughing and while the band was playing,\nthis marvel had come to the lane. Happy... happy... All is well, said that\nsleeping face. This is just as it should be. I am content.\n\nBut all the same you had to cry, and she couldn't go out of the room\nwithout saying something to him. Laura gave a loud childish sob.\n\n\"Forgive my hat,\" she said.\n\nAnd this time she didn't wait for Em's sister. She found her way out of\nthe door, down the path, past all those dark people. At the corner of\nthe lane she met Laurie.\n\nHe stepped out of the shadow. \"Is that you, Laura?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"Mother was getting anxious. Was it all right?\"\n\n\"Yes, quite. Oh, Laurie!\" She took his arm, she pressed up against him.\n\n\"I say, you're not crying, are you?\" asked her brother.\n\nLaura shook her head. She was.\n\nLaurie put his arm round her shoulder. \"Don't cry,\" he said in his warm,\nloving voice. \"Was it awful?\"\n\n\"No,\" sobbed Laura. \"It was simply marvellous. But Laurie--\" She\nstopped, she looked at her brother. \"Isn't life,\" she stammered, \"isn't\nlife--\" But what life was she couldn't explain. No matter. He quite\nunderstood.\n\n\"Isn't it, darling?\" said Laurie.\n\n\n\n\n</CHAPTER>\n"}, {"id": 3, "text": "<CHAPTER>\n3. THE DAUGHTERS OF THE LATE COLONEL. Chapter 3.I.\n\nThe week after was one of the busiest weeks of their lives. Even when\nthey went to bed it was only their bodies that lay down and rested;\ntheir minds went on, thinking things out, talking things over,\nwondering, deciding, trying to remember where...\n\nConstantia lay like a statue, her hands by her sides, her feet just\noverlapping each other, the sheet up to her chin. She stared at the\nceiling.\n\n\"Do you think father would mind if we gave his top-hat to the porter?\"\n\n\"The porter?\" snapped Josephine. \"Why ever the porter? What a very\nextraordinary idea!\"\n\n\"Because,\" said Constantia slowly, \"he must often have to go to\nfunerals. And I noticed at--at the cemetery that he only had a bowler.\"\nShe paused. \"I thought then how very much he'd appreciate a top-hat. We\nought to give him a present, too. He was always very nice to father.\"\n\n\"But,\" cried Josephine, flouncing on her pillow and staring across the\ndark at Constantia, \"father's head!\" And suddenly, for one awful moment,\nshe nearly giggled. Not, of course, that she felt in the least like\ngiggling. It must have been habit. Years ago, when they had stayed awake\nat night talking, their beds had simply heaved. And now the porter's\nhead, disappearing, popped out, like a candle, under father's hat... The\ngiggle mounted, mounted; she clenched her hands; she fought it down; she\nfrowned fiercely at the dark and said \"Remember\" terribly sternly.\n\n\"We can decide to-morrow,\" she said.\n\nConstantia had noticed nothing; she sighed.\n\n\"Do you think we ought to have our dressing-gowns dyed as well?\"\n\n\"Black?\" almost shrieked Josephine.\n\n\"Well, what else?\" said Constantia. \"I was thinking--it doesn't seem\nquite sincere, in a way, to wear black out of doors and when we're fully\ndressed, and then when we're at home--\"\n\n\"But nobody sees us,\" said Josephine. She gave the bedclothes such a\ntwitch that both her feet became uncovered, and she had to creep up the\npillows to get them well under again.\n\n\"Kate does,\" said Constantia. \"And the postman very well might.\"\n\nJosephine thought of her dark-red slippers, which matched her\ndressing-gown, and of Constantia's favourite indefinite green ones which\nwent with hers. Black! Two black dressing-gowns and two pairs of black\nwoolly slippers, creeping off to the bathroom like black cats.\n\n\"I don't think it's absolutely necessary,\" said she.\n\nSilence. Then Constantia said, \"We shall have to post the papers with\nthe notice in them to-morrow to catch the Ceylon mail... How many letters\nhave we had up till now?\"\n\n\"Twenty-three.\"\n\nJosephine had replied to them all, and twenty-three times when she came\nto \"We miss our dear father so much\" she had broken down and had to use\nher handkerchief, and on some of them even to soak up a very light-blue\ntear with an edge of blotting-paper. Strange! She couldn't have put\nit on--but twenty-three times. Even now, though, when she said over to\nherself sadly \"We miss our dear father so much,\" she could have cried if\nshe'd wanted to.\n\n\"Have you got enough stamps?\" came from Constantia.\n\n\"Oh, how can I tell?\" said Josephine crossly. \"What's the good of asking\nme that now?\"\n\n\"I was just wondering,\" said Constantia mildly.\n\nSilence again. There came a little rustle, a scurry, a hop.\n\n\"A mouse,\" said Constantia.\n\n\"It can't be a mouse because there aren't any crumbs,\" said Josephine.\n\n\"But it doesn't know there aren't,\" said Constantia.\n\nA spasm of pity squeezed her heart. Poor little thing! She wished she'd\nleft a tiny piece of biscuit on the dressing-table. It was awful to\nthink of it not finding anything. What would it do?\n\n\"I can't think how they manage to live at all,\" she said slowly.\n\n\"Who?\" demanded Josephine.\n\nAnd Constantia said more loudly than she meant to, \"Mice.\"\n\nJosephine was furious. \"Oh, what nonsense, Con!\" she said. \"What have\nmice got to do with it? You're asleep.\"\n\n\"I don't think I am,\" said Constantia. She shut her eyes to make sure.\nShe was.\n\nJosephine arched her spine, pulled up her knees, folded her arms so that\nher fists came under her ears, and pressed her cheek hard against the\npillow.\n\n\nChapter 3.II.\n\nAnother thing which complicated matters was they had Nurse Andrews\nstaying on with them that week. It was their own fault; they had asked\nher. It was Josephine's idea. On the morning--well, on the last morning,\nwhen the doctor had gone, Josephine had said to Constantia, \"Don't you\nthink it would be rather nice if we asked Nurse Andrews to stay on for a\nweek as our guest?\"\n\n\"Very nice,\" said Constantia.\n\n\"I thought,\" went on Josephine quickly, \"I should just say this\nafternoon, after I've paid her, 'My sister and I would be very pleased,\nafter all you've done for us, Nurse Andrews, if you would stay on for\na week as our guest.' I'd have to put that in about being our guest in\ncase--\"\n\n\"Oh, but she could hardly expect to be paid!\" cried Constantia.\n\n\"One never knows,\" said Josephine sagely.\n\nNurse Andrews had, of course, jumped at the idea. But it was a bother.\nIt meant they had to have regular sit-down meals at the proper times,\nwhereas if they'd been alone they could just have asked Kate if she\nwouldn't have minded bringing them a tray wherever they were. And\nmeal-times now that the strain was over were rather a trial.\n\nNurse Andrews was simply fearful about butter. Really they couldn't\nhelp feeling that about butter, at least, she took advantage of their\nkindness. And she had that maddening habit of asking for just an inch\nmore of bread to finish what she had on her plate, and then, at the last\nmouthful, absent-mindedly--of course it wasn't absent-mindedly--taking\nanother helping. Josephine got very red when this happened, and she\nfastened her small, bead-like eyes on the tablecloth as if she saw a\nminute strange insect creeping through the web of it. But Constantia's\nlong, pale face lengthened and set, and she gazed away--away--far\nover the desert, to where that line of camels unwound like a thread of\nwool...\n\n\"When I was with Lady Tukes,\" said Nurse Andrews, \"she had such a dainty\nlittle contrayvance for the buttah. It was a silvah Cupid balanced on\nthe--on the bordah of a glass dish, holding a tayny fork. And when you\nwanted some buttah you simply pressed his foot and he bent down and\nspeared you a piece. It was quite a gayme.\"\n\nJosephine could hardly bear that. But \"I think those things are very\nextravagant\" was all she said.\n\n\"But whey?\" asked Nurse Andrews, beaming through her eyeglasses. \"No\none, surely, would take more buttah than one wanted--would one?\"\n\n\"Ring, Con,\" cried Josephine. She couldn't trust herself to reply.\n\nAnd proud young Kate, the enchanted princess, came in to see what the\nold tabbies wanted now. She snatched away their plates of mock something\nor other and slapped down a white, terrified blancmange.\n\n\"Jam, please, Kate,\" said Josephine kindly.\n\nKate knelt and burst open the sideboard, lifted the lid of the jam-pot,\nsaw it was empty, put it on the table, and stalked off.\n\n\"I'm afraid,\" said Nurse Andrews a moment later, \"there isn't any.\"\n\n\"Oh, what a bother!\" said Josephine. She bit her lip. \"What had we\nbetter do?\"\n\nConstantia looked dubious. \"We can't disturb Kate again,\" she said\nsoftly.\n\nNurse Andrews waited, smiling at them both. Her eyes wandered, spying at\neverything behind her eyeglasses. Constantia in despair went back to her\ncamels. Josephine frowned heavily--concentrated. If it hadn't been\nfor this idiotic woman she and Con would, of course, have eaten their\nblancmange without. Suddenly the idea came.\n\n\"I know,\" she said. \"Marmalade. There's some marmalade in the sideboard.\nGet it, Con.\"\n\n\"I hope,\" laughed Nurse Andrews--and her laugh was like a spoon tinkling\nagainst a medicine-glass--\"I hope it's not very bittah marmalayde.\"\n\n\nChapter 3.III.\n\nBut, after all, it was not long now, and then she'd be gone for good.\nAnd there was no getting over the fact that she had been very kind\nto father. She had nursed him day and night at the end. Indeed, both\nConstantia and Josephine felt privately she had rather overdone the not\nleaving him at the very last. For when they had gone in to say good-bye\nNurse Andrews had sat beside his bed the whole time, holding his wrist\nand pretending to look at her watch. It couldn't have been necessary.\nIt was so tactless, too. Supposing father had wanted to say\nsomething--something private to them. Not that he had. Oh, far from it!\nHe lay there, purple, a dark, angry purple in the face, and never even\nlooked at them when they came in. Then, as they were standing there,\nwondering what to do, he had suddenly opened one eye. Oh, what a\ndifference it would have made, what a difference to their memory of him,\nhow much easier to tell people about it, if he had only opened both! But\nno--one eye only. It glared at them a moment and then... went out.\n\n\nChapter 3.IV.\n\nIt had made it very awkward for them when Mr. Farolles, of St. John's,\ncalled the same afternoon.\n\n\"The end was quite peaceful, I trust?\" were the first words he said as\nhe glided towards them through the dark drawing-room.\n\n\"Quite,\" said Josephine faintly. They both hung their heads. Both of\nthem felt certain that eye wasn't at all a peaceful eye.\n\n\"Won't you sit down?\" said Josephine.\n\n\"Thank you, Miss Pinner,\" said Mr. Farolles gratefully. He folded his\ncoat-tails and began to lower himself into father's arm-chair, but\njust as he touched it he almost sprang up and slid into the next chair\ninstead.\n\nHe coughed. Josephine clasped her hands; Constantia looked vague.\n\n\"I want you to feel, Miss Pinner,\" said Mr. Farolles, \"and you, Miss\nConstantia, that I'm trying to be helpful. I want to be helpful to you\nboth, if you will let me. These are the times,\" said Mr Farolles, very\nsimply and earnestly, \"when God means us to be helpful to one another.\"\n\n\"Thank you very much, Mr. Farolles,\" said Josephine and Constantia.\n\n\"Not at all,\" said Mr. Farolles gently. He drew his kid gloves through\nhis fingers and leaned forward. \"And if either of you would like a\nlittle Communion, either or both of you, here and now, you have only\nto tell me. A little Communion is often very help--a great comfort,\" he\nadded tenderly.\n\nBut the idea of a little Communion terrified them. What! In the\ndrawing-room by themselves--with no--no altar or anything! The piano\nwould be much too high, thought Constantia, and Mr. Farolles could not\npossibly lean over it with the chalice. And Kate would be sure to come\nbursting in and interrupt them, thought Josephine. And supposing the\nbell rang in the middle? It might be somebody important--about their\nmourning. Would they get up reverently and go out, or would they have to\nwait... in torture?\n\n\"Perhaps you will send round a note by your good Kate if you would care\nfor it later,\" said Mr. Farolles.\n\n\"Oh yes, thank you very much!\" they both said.\n\nMr. Farolles got up and took his black straw hat from the round table.\n\n\"And about the funeral,\" he said softly. \"I may arrange that--as your\ndear father's old friend and yours, Miss Pinner--and Miss Constantia?\"\n\nJosephine and Constantia got up too.\n\n\"I should like it to be quite simple,\" said Josephine firmly, \"and not\ntoo expensive. At the same time, I should like--\"\n\n\"A good one that will last,\" thought dreamy Constantia, as if Josephine\nwere buying a nightgown. But, of course, Josephine didn't say that. \"One\nsuitable to our father's position.\" She was very nervous.\n\n\"I'll run round to our good friend Mr. Knight,\" said Mr. Farolles\nsoothingly. \"I will ask him to come and see you. I am sure you will find\nhim very helpful indeed.\"\n\n\nChapter 3.V.\n\nWell, at any rate, all that part of it was over, though neither of them\ncould possibly believe that father was never coming back. Josephine had\nhad a moment of absolute terror at the cemetery, while the coffin was\nlowered, to think that she and Constantia had done this thing without\nasking his permission. What would father say when he found out? For he\nwas bound to find out sooner or later. He always did. \"Buried. You two\ngirls had me buried!\" She heard his stick thumping. Oh, what would\nthey say? What possible excuse could they make? It sounded such an\nappallingly heartless thing to do. Such a wicked advantage to take of\na person because he happened to be helpless at the moment. The\nother people seemed to treat it all as a matter of course. They were\nstrangers; they couldn't be expected to understand that father was the\nvery last person for such a thing to happen to. No, the entire blame for\nit all would fall on her and Constantia. And the expense, she thought,\nstepping into the tight-buttoned cab. When she had to show him the\nbills. What would he say then?\n\nShe heard him absolutely roaring. \"And do you expect me to pay for this\ngimcrack excursion of yours?\"\n\n\"Oh,\" groaned poor Josephine aloud, \"we shouldn't have done it, Con!\"\n\nAnd Constantia, pale as a lemon in all that blackness, said in a\nfrightened whisper, \"Done what, Jug?\"\n\n\"Let them bu-bury father like that,\" said Josephine, breaking down and\ncrying into her new, queer-smelling mourning handkerchief.\n\n\"But what else could we have done?\" asked Constantia wonderingly. \"We\ncouldn't have kept him, Jug--we couldn't have kept him unburied. At any\nrate, not in a flat that size.\"\n\nJosephine blew her nose; the cab was dreadfully stuffy.\n\n\"I don't know,\" she said forlornly. \"It is all so dreadful. I feel we\nought to have tried to, just for a time at least. To make perfectly\nsure. One thing's certain\"--and her tears sprang out again--\"father will\nnever forgive us for this--never!\"\n\n\nChapter 3.VI.\n\nFather would never forgive them. That was what they felt more than ever\nwhen, two mornings later, they went into his room to go through\nhis things. They had discussed it quite calmly. It was even down on\nJosephine's list of things to be done. \"Go through father's things and\nsettle about them.\" But that was a very different matter from saying\nafter breakfast:\n\n\"Well, are you ready, Con?\"\n\n\"Yes, Jug--when you are.\"\n\n\"Then I think we'd better get it over.\"\n\nIt was dark in the hall. It had been a rule for years never to disturb\nfather in the morning, whatever happened. And now they were going to\nopen the door without knocking even... Constantia's eyes were enormous at\nthe idea; Josephine felt weak in the knees.\n\n\"You--you go first,\" she gasped, pushing Constantia.\n\nBut Constantia said, as she always had said on those occasions, \"No,\nJug, that's not fair. You're the eldest.\"\n\nJosephine was just going to say--what at other times she wouldn't have\nowned to for the world--what she kept for her very last weapon, \"But\nyou're the tallest,\" when they noticed that the kitchen door was open,\nand there stood Kate...\n\n\"Very stiff,\" said Josephine, grasping the doorhandle and doing her best\nto turn it. As if anything ever deceived Kate!\n\nIt couldn't be helped. That girl was... Then the door was shut behind\nthem, but--but they weren't in father's room at all. They might have\nsuddenly walked through the wall by mistake into a different flat\naltogether. Was the door just behind them? They were too frightened to\nlook. Josephine knew that if it was it was holding itself tight shut;\nConstantia felt that, like the doors in dreams, it hadn't any handle\nat all. It was the coldness which made it so awful. Or the\nwhiteness--which? Everything was covered. The blinds were down, a cloth\nhung over the mirror, a sheet hid the bed; a huge fan of white paper\nfilled the fireplace. Constantia timidly put out her hand; she almost\nexpected a snowflake to fall. Josephine felt a queer tingling in her\nnose, as if her nose was freezing. Then a cab klop-klopped over the\ncobbles below, and the quiet seemed to shake into little pieces.\n\n\"I had better pull up a blind,\" said Josephine bravely.\n\n\"Yes, it might be a good idea,\" whispered Constantia.\n\nThey only gave the blind a touch, but it flew up and the cord flew\nafter, rolling round the blind-stick, and the little tassel tapped as if\ntrying to get free. That was too much for Constantia.\n\n\"Don't you think--don't you think we might put it off for another day?\"\nshe whispered.\n\n\"Why?\" snapped Josephine, feeling, as usual, much better now that she\nknew for certain that Constantia was terrified. \"It's got to be done.\nBut I do wish you wouldn't whisper, Con.\"\n\n\"I didn't know I was whispering,\" whispered Constantia.\n\n\"And why do you keep staring at the bed?\" said Josephine, raising her\nvoice almost defiantly. \"There's nothing on the bed.\"\n\n\"Oh, Jug, don't say so!\" said poor Connie. \"At any rate, not so loudly.\"\n\nJosephine felt herself that she had gone too far. She took a wide swerve\nover to the chest of drawers, put out her hand, but quickly drew it back\nagain.\n\n\"Connie!\" she gasped, and she wheeled round and leaned with her back\nagainst the chest of drawers.\n\n\"Oh, Jug--what?\"\n\nJosephine could only glare. She had the most extraordinary feeling that\nshe had just escaped something simply awful. But how could she explain\nto Constantia that father was in the chest of drawers? He was in the\ntop drawer with his handkerchiefs and neckties, or in the next with\nhis shirts and pyjamas, or in the lowest of all with his suits. He\nwas watching there, hidden away--just behind the door-handle--ready to\nspring.\n\nShe pulled a funny old-fashioned face at Constantia, just as she used to\nin the old days when she was going to cry.\n\n\"I can't open,\" she nearly wailed.\n\n\"No, don't, Jug,\" whispered Constantia earnestly. \"It's much better not\nto. Don't let's open anything. At any rate, not for a long time.\"\n\n\"But--but it seems so weak,\" said Josephine, breaking down.\n\n\"But why not be weak for once, Jug?\" argued Constantia, whispering\nquite fiercely. \"If it is weak.\" And her pale stare flew from the locked\nwriting-table--so safe--to the huge glittering wardrobe, and she began\nto breathe in a queer, panting away. \"Why shouldn't we be weak for once\nin our lives, Jug? It's quite excusable. Let's be weak--be weak, Jug.\nIt's much nicer to be weak than to be strong.\"\n\nAnd then she did one of those amazingly bold things that she'd done\nabout twice before in their lives: she marched over to the wardrobe,\nturned the key, and took it out of the lock. Took it out of the lock and\nheld it up to Josephine, showing Josephine by her extraordinary smile\nthat she knew what she'd done--she'd risked deliberately father being in\nthere among his overcoats.\n\nIf the huge wardrobe had lurched forward, had crashed down on\nConstantia, Josephine wouldn't have been surprised. On the contrary,\nshe would have thought it the only suitable thing to happen. But nothing\nhappened. Only the room seemed quieter than ever, and the bigger flakes\nof cold air fell on Josephine's shoulders and knees. She began to\nshiver.\n\n\"Come, Jug,\" said Constantia, still with that awful callous smile, and\nJosephine followed just as she had that last time, when Constantia had\npushed Benny into the round pond.\n\n\nChapter 3.VII.\n\nBut the strain told on them when they were back in the dining-room. They\nsat down, very shaky, and looked at each other.\n\n\"I don't feel I can settle to anything,\" said Josephine, \"until I've had\nsomething. Do you think we could ask Kate for two cups of hot water?\"\n\n\"I really don't see why we shouldn't,\" said Constantia carefully. She\nwas quite normal again. \"I won't ring. I'll go to the kitchen door and\nask her.\"\n\n\"Yes, do,\" said Josephine, sinking down into a chair. \"Tell her, just\ntwo cups, Con, nothing else--on a tray.\"\n\n\"She needn't even put the jug on, need she?\" said Constantia, as though\nKate might very well complain if the jug had been there.\n\n\"Oh no, certainly not! The jug's not at all necessary. She can pour\nit direct out of the kettle,\" cried Josephine, feeling that would be a\nlabour-saving indeed.\n\nTheir cold lips quivered at the greenish brims. Josephine curved her\nsmall red hands round the cup; Constantia sat up and blew on the wavy\nsteam, making it flutter from one side to the other.\n\n\"Speaking of Benny,\" said Josephine.\n\nAnd though Benny hadn't been mentioned Constantia immediately looked as\nthough he had.\n\n\"He'll expect us to send him something of father's, of course. But it's\nso difficult to know what to send to Ceylon.\"\n\n\"You mean things get unstuck so on the voyage,\" murmured Constantia.\n\n\"No, lost,\" said Josephine sharply. \"You know there's no post. Only\nrunners.\"\n\nBoth paused to watch a black man in white linen drawers running through\nthe pale fields for dear life, with a large brown-paper parcel in his\nhands. Josephine's black man was tiny; he scurried along glistening like\nan ant. But there was something blind and tireless about Constantia's\ntall, thin fellow, which made him, she decided, a very unpleasant person\nindeed... On the veranda, dressed all in white and wearing a cork helmet,\nstood Benny. His right hand shook up and down, as father's did when he\nwas impatient. And behind him, not in the least interested, sat Hilda,\nthe unknown sister-in-law. She swung in a cane rocker and flicked over\nthe leaves of the \"Tatler.\"\n\n\"I think his watch would be the most suitable present,\" said Josephine.\n\nConstantia looked up; she seemed surprised.\n\n\"Oh, would you trust a gold watch to a native?\"\n\n\"But of course, I'd disguise it,\" said Josephine. \"No one would know\nit was a watch.\" She liked the idea of having to make a parcel such a\ncurious shape that no one could possibly guess what it was. She\neven thought for a moment of hiding the watch in a narrow cardboard\ncorset-box that she'd kept by her for a long time, waiting for it to\ncome in for something. It was such beautiful, firm cardboard. But, no,\nit wouldn't be appropriate for this occasion. It had lettering on it:\n\"Medium Women's 28. Extra Firm Busks.\" It would be almost too much of a\nsurprise for Benny to open that and find father's watch inside.\n\n\"And of course it isn't as though it would be going--ticking, I mean,\"\nsaid Constantia, who was still thinking of the native love of jewellery.\n\"At least,\" she added, \"it would be very strange if after all that time\nit was.\"\n\n\nChapter 3.VIII.\n\nJosephine made no reply. She had flown off on one of her tangents.\nShe had suddenly thought of Cyril. Wasn't it more usual for the only\ngrandson to have the watch? And then dear Cyril was so appreciative, and\na gold watch meant so much to a young man. Benny, in all probability,\nhad quite got out of the habit of watches; men so seldom wore waistcoats\nin those hot climates. Whereas Cyril in London wore them from year's end\nto year's end. And it would be so nice for her and Constantia, when he\ncame to tea, to know it was there. \"I see you've got on grandfather's\nwatch, Cyril.\" It would be somehow so satisfactory.\n\nDear boy! What a blow his sweet, sympathetic little note had been! Of\ncourse they quite understood; but it was most unfortunate.\n\n\"It would have been such a point, having him,\" said Josephine.\n\n\"And he would have enjoyed it so,\" said Constantia, not thinking what\nshe was saying.\n\nHowever, as soon as he got back he was coming to tea with his aunties.\nCyril to tea was one of their rare treats.\n\n\"Now, Cyril, you mustn't be frightened of our cakes. Your Auntie Con and\nI bought them at Buszard's this morning. We know what a man's appetite\nis. So don't be ashamed of making a good tea.\"\n\nJosephine cut recklessly into the rich dark cake that stood for her\nwinter gloves or the soling and heeling of Constantia's only respectable\nshoes. But Cyril was most unmanlike in appetite.\n\n\"I say, Aunt Josephine, I simply can't. I've only just had lunch, you\nknow.\"\n\n\"Oh, Cyril, that can't be true! It's after four,\" cried Josephine.\nConstantia sat with her knife poised over the chocolate-roll.\n\n\"It is, all the same,\" said Cyril. \"I had to meet a man at Victoria, and\nhe kept me hanging about till... there was only time to get lunch and\nto come on here. And he gave me--phew\"--Cyril put his hand to his\nforehead--\"a terrific blow-out,\" he said.\n\nIt was disappointing--to-day of all days. But still he couldn't be\nexpected to know.\n\n\"But you'll have a meringue, won't you, Cyril?\" said Aunt Josephine.\n\"These meringues were bought specially for you. Your dear father was so\nfond of them. We were sure you are, too.\"\n\n\"I am, Aunt Josephine,\" cried Cyril ardently. \"Do you mind if I take\nhalf to begin with?\"\n\n\"Not at all, dear boy; but we mustn't let you off with that.\"\n\n\"Is your dear father still so fond of meringues?\" asked Auntie Con\ngently. She winced faintly as she broke through the shell of hers.\n\n\"Well, I don't quite know, Auntie Con,\" said Cyril breezily.\n\nAt that they both looked up.\n\n\"Don't know?\" almost snapped Josephine. \"Don't know a thing like that\nabout your own father, Cyril?\"\n\n\"Surely,\" said Auntie Con softly.\n\nCyril tried to laugh it off. \"Oh, well,\" he said, \"it's such a long time\nsince--\" He faltered. He stopped. Their faces were too much for him.\n\n\"Even so,\" said Josephine.\n\nAnd Auntie Con looked.\n\nCyril put down his teacup. \"Wait a bit,\" he cried. \"Wait a bit, Aunt\nJosephine. What am I thinking of?\"\n\nHe looked up. They were beginning to brighten. Cyril slapped his knee.\n\n\"Of course,\" he said, \"it was meringues. How could I have forgotten?\nYes, Aunt Josephine, you're perfectly right. Father's most frightfully\nkeen on meringues.\"\n\nThey didn't only beam. Aunt Josephine went scarlet with pleasure; Auntie\nCon gave a deep, deep sigh.\n\n\"And now, Cyril, you must come and see father,\" said Josephine. \"He\nknows you were coming to-day.\"\n\n\"Right,\" said Cyril, very firmly and heartily. He got up from his chair;\nsuddenly he glanced at the clock.\n\n\"I say, Auntie Con, isn't your clock a bit slow? I've got to meet a man\nat--at Paddington just after five. I'm afraid I shan't be able to stay\nvery long with grandfather.\"\n\n\"Oh, he won't expect you to stay very long!\" said Aunt Josephine.\n\nConstantia was still gazing at the clock. She couldn't make up her mind\nif it was fast or slow. It was one or the other, she felt almost certain\nof that. At any rate, it had been.\n\nCyril still lingered. \"Aren't you coming along, Auntie Con?\"\n\n\"Of course,\" said Josephine, \"we shall all go. Come on, Con.\"\n\n\nChapter 3.IX.\n\nThey knocked at the door, and Cyril followed his aunts into\ngrandfather's hot, sweetish room.\n\n\"Come on,\" said Grandfather Pinner. \"Don't hang about. What is it?\nWhat've you been up to?\"\n\nHe was sitting in front of a roaring fire, clasping his stick. He had a\nthick rug over his knees. On his lap there lay a beautiful pale yellow\nsilk handkerchief.\n\n\"It's Cyril, father,\" said Josephine shyly. And she took Cyril's hand\nand led him forward.\n\n\"Good afternoon, grandfather,\" said Cyril, trying to take his hand out\nof Aunt Josephine's. Grandfather Pinner shot his eyes at Cyril in the\nway he was famous for. Where was Auntie Con? She stood on the other side\nof Aunt Josephine; her long arms hung down in front of her; her hands\nwere clasped. She never took her eyes off grandfather.\n\n\"Well,\" said Grandfather Pinner, beginning to thump, \"what have you got\nto tell me?\"\n\nWhat had he, what had he got to tell him? Cyril felt himself smiling\nlike a perfect imbecile. The room was stifling, too.\n\nBut Aunt Josephine came to his rescue. She cried brightly, \"Cyril says\nhis father is still very fond of meringues, father dear.\"\n\n\"Eh?\" said Grandfather Pinner, curving his hand like a purple\nmeringue-shell over one ear.\n\nJosephine repeated, \"Cyril says his father is still very fond of\nmeringues.\"\n\n\"Can't hear,\" said old Colonel Pinner. And he waved Josephine away with\nhis stick, then pointed with his stick to Cyril. \"Tell me what she's\ntrying to say,\" he said.\n\n(My God!) \"Must I?\" said Cyril, blushing and staring at Aunt Josephine.\n\n\"Do, dear,\" she smiled. \"It will please him so much.\"\n\n\"Come on, out with it!\" cried Colonel Pinner testily, beginning to thump\nagain.\n\nAnd Cyril leaned forward and yelled, \"Father's still very fond of\nmeringues.\"\n\nAt that Grandfather Pinner jumped as though he had been shot.\n\n\"Don't shout!\" he cried. \"What's the matter with the boy? Meringues!\nWhat about 'em?\"\n\n\"Oh, Aunt Josephine, must we go on?\" groaned Cyril desperately.\n\n\"It's quite all right, dear boy,\" said Aunt Josephine, as though he and\nshe were at the dentist's together. \"He'll understand in a minute.\" And\nshe whispered to Cyril, \"He's getting a bit deaf, you know.\" Then she\nleaned forward and really bawled at Grandfather Pinner, \"Cyril only\nwanted to tell you, father dear, that his father is still very fond of\nmeringues.\"\n\nColonel Pinner heard that time, heard and brooded, looking Cyril up and\ndown.\n\n\"What an esstrordinary thing!\" said old Grandfather Pinner. \"What an\nesstrordinary thing to come all this way here to tell me!\"\n\nAnd Cyril felt it was.\n\n\"Yes, I shall send Cyril the watch,\" said Josephine.\n\n\"That would be very nice,\" said Constantia. \"I seem to remember last\ntime he came there was some little trouble about the time.\"\n\n\nChapter 3.X.\n\nThey were interrupted by Kate bursting through the door in her usual\nfashion, as though she had discovered some secret panel in the wall.\n\n\"Fried or boiled?\" asked the bold voice.\n\nFried or boiled? Josephine and Constantia were quite bewildered for the\nmoment. They could hardly take it in.\n\n\"Fried or boiled what, Kate?\" asked Josephine, trying to begin to\nconcentrate.\n\nKate gave a loud sniff. \"Fish.\"\n\n\"Well, why didn't you say so immediately?\" Josephine reproached her\ngently. \"How could you expect us to understand, Kate? There are a great\nmany things in this world you know, which are fried or boiled.\" And\nafter such a display of courage she said quite brightly to Constantia,\n\"Which do you prefer, Con?\"\n\n\"I think it might be nice to have it fried,\" said Constantia. \"On the\nother hand, of course, boiled fish is very nice. I think I prefer both\nequally well... Unless you... In that case--\"\n\n\"I shall fry it,\" said Kate, and she bounced back, leaving their door\nopen and slamming the door of her kitchen.\n\nJosephine gazed at Constantia; she raised her pale eyebrows until they\nrippled away into her pale hair. She got up. She said in a very\nlofty, imposing way, \"Do you mind following me into the drawing-room,\nConstantia? I've got something of great importance to discuss with you.\"\n\nFor it was always to the drawing-room they retired when they wanted to\ntalk over Kate.\n\nJosephine closed the door meaningly. \"Sit down, Constantia,\" she said,\nstill very grand. She might have been receiving Constantia for the\nfirst time. And Con looked round vaguely for a chair, as though she felt\nindeed quite a stranger.\n\n\"Now the question is,\" said Josephine, bending forward, \"whether we\nshall keep her or not.\"\n\n\"That is the question,\" agreed Constantia.\n\n\"And this time,\" said Josephine firmly, \"we must come to a definite\ndecision.\"\n\nConstantia looked for a moment as though she might begin going over all\nthe other times, but she pulled herself together and said, \"Yes, Jug.\"\n\n\"You see, Con,\" explained Josephine, \"everything is so changed now.\"\nConstantia looked up quickly. \"I mean,\" went on Josephine, \"we're not\ndependent on Kate as we were.\" And she blushed faintly. \"There's not\nfather to cook for.\"\n\n\"That is perfectly true,\" agreed Constantia. \"Father certainly doesn't\nwant any cooking now, whatever else--\"\n\nJosephine broke in sharply, \"You're not sleepy, are you, Con?\"\n\n\"Sleepy, Jug?\" Constantia was wide-eyed.\n\n\"Well, concentrate more,\" said Josephine sharply, and she returned\nto the subject. \"What it comes to is, if we did\"--and this she barely\nbreathed, glancing at the door--\"give Kate notice\"--she raised her voice\nagain--\"we could manage our own food.\"\n\n\"Why not?\" cried Constantia. She couldn't help smiling. The idea was so\nexciting. She clasped her hands. \"What should we live on, Jug?\"\n\n\"Oh, eggs in various forms!\" said Jug, lofty again. \"And, besides, there\nare all the cooked foods.\"\n\n\"But I've always heard,\" said Constantia, \"they are considered so very\nexpensive.\"\n\n\"Not if one buys them in moderation,\" said Josephine. But she tore\nherself away from this fascinating bypath and dragged Constantia after\nher.\n\n\"What we've got to decide now, however, is whether we really do trust\nKate or not.\"\n\nConstantia leaned back. Her flat little laugh flew from her lips.\n\n\"Isn't it curious, Jug,\" said she, \"that just on this one subject I've\nnever been able to quite make up my mind?\"\n\n\nChapter 3.XI.\n\nShe never had. The whole difficulty was to prove anything. How did one\nprove things, how could one? Suppose Kate had stood in front of her\nand deliberately made a face. Mightn't she very well have been in pain?\nWasn't it impossible, at any rate, to ask Kate if she was making a face\nat her? If Kate answered \"No\"--and, of course, she would say \"No\"--what\na position! How undignified! Then again Constantia suspected, she was\nalmost certain that Kate went to her chest of drawers when she and\nJosephine were out, not to take things but to spy. Many times she had\ncome back to find her amethyst cross in the most unlikely places, under\nher lace ties or on top of her evening Bertha. More than once she had\nlaid a trap for Kate. She had arranged things in a special order and\nthen called Josephine to witness.\n\n\"You see, Jug?\"\n\n\"Quite, Con.\"\n\n\"Now we shall be able to tell.\"\n\nBut, oh dear, when she did go to look, she was as far off from a proof\nas ever! If anything was displaced, it might so very well have happened\nas she closed the drawer; a jolt might have done it so easily.\n\n\"You come, Jug, and decide. I really can't. It's too difficult.\"\n\nBut after a pause and a long glare Josephine would sigh, \"Now you've put\nthe doubt into my mind, Con, I'm sure I can't tell myself.\"\n\n\"Well, we can't postpone it again,\" said Josephine. \"If we postpone it\nthis time--\"\n\n\nChapter 3.XII.\n\nBut at that moment in the street below a barrel-organ struck up.\nJosephine and Constantia sprang to their feet together.\n\n\"Run, Con,\" said Josephine. \"Run quickly. There's sixpence on the--\"\n\nThen they remembered. It didn't matter. They would never have to stop\nthe organ-grinder again. Never again would she and Constantia be told to\nmake that monkey take his noise somewhere else. Never would sound that\nloud, strange bellow when father thought they were not hurrying enough.\nThe organ-grinder might play there all day and the stick would not\nthump.\n\n     \"It never will thump again,\n      It never will thump again,\n\nplayed the barrel-organ.\n\nWhat was Constantia thinking? She had such a strange smile; she looked\ndifferent. She couldn't be going to cry.\n\n\"Jug, Jug,\" said Constantia softly, pressing her hands together. \"Do you\nknow what day it is? It's Saturday. It's a week to-day, a whole week.\"\n\n     \"A week since father died,\n      A week since father died,\"\n\ncried the barrel-organ. And Josephine, too, forgot to be practical and\nsensible; she smiled faintly, strangely. On the Indian carpet there fell\na square of sunlight, pale red; it came and went and came--and stayed,\ndeepened--until it shone almost golden.\n\n\"The sun's out,\" said Josephine, as though it really mattered.\n\nA perfect fountain of bubbling notes shook from the barrel-organ, round,\nbright notes, carelessly scattered.\n\nConstantia lifted her big, cold hands as if to catch them, and then her\nhands fell again. She walked over to the mantelpiece to her favourite\nBuddha. And the stone and gilt image, whose smile always gave her such\na queer feeling, almost a pain and yet a pleasant pain, seemed to-day\nto be more than smiling. He knew something; he had a secret. \"I know\nsomething that you don't know,\" said her Buddha. Oh, what was it, what\ncould it be? And yet she had always felt there was... something.\n\nThe sunlight pressed through the windows, thieved its way in, flashed\nits light over the furniture and the photographs. Josephine watched it.\nWhen it came to mother's photograph, the enlargement over the piano, it\nlingered as though puzzled to find so little remained of mother, except\nthe earrings shaped like tiny pagodas and a black feather boa. Why did\nthe photographs of dead people always fade so? wondered Josephine. As\nsoon as a person was dead their photograph died too. But, of course,\nthis one of mother was very old. It was thirty-five years old. Josephine\nremembered standing on a chair and pointing out that feather boa to\nConstantia and telling her that it was a snake that had killed their\nmother in Ceylon... Would everything have been different if mother hadn't\ndied? She didn't see why. Aunt Florence had lived with them until they\nhad left school, and they had moved three times and had their yearly\nholiday and... and there'd been changes of servants, of course.\n\nSome little sparrows, young sparrows they sounded, chirped on the\nwindow-ledge. \"Yeep--eyeep--yeep.\" But Josephine felt they were not\nsparrows, not on the window-ledge. It was inside her, that queer little\ncrying noise. \"Yeep--eyeep--yeep.\" Ah, what was it crying, so weak and\nforlorn?\n\nIf mother had lived, might they have married? But there had been nobody\nfor them to marry. There had been father's Anglo-Indian friends before\nhe quarrelled with them. But after that she and Constantia never met a\nsingle man except clergymen. How did one meet men? Or even if they'd met\nthem, how could they have got to know men well enough to be more than\nstrangers? One read of people having adventures, being followed, and so\non. But nobody had ever followed Constantia and her. Oh yes, there had\nbeen one year at Eastbourne a mysterious man at their boarding-house who\nhad put a note on the jug of hot water outside their bedroom door! But\nby the time Connie had found it the steam had made the writing too faint\nto read; they couldn't even make out to which of them it was addressed.\nAnd he had left next day. And that was all. The rest had been looking\nafter father, and at the same time keeping out of father's way. But now?\nBut now? The thieving sun touched Josephine gently. She lifted her face.\nShe was drawn over to the window by gentle beams...\n\nUntil the barrel-organ stopped playing Constantia stayed before the\nBuddha, wondering, but not as usual, not vaguely. This time her wonder\nwas like longing. She remembered the times she had come in here, crept\nout of bed in her nightgown when the moon was full, and lain on the\nfloor with her arms outstretched, as though she was crucified. Why? The\nbig, pale moon had made her do it. The horrible dancing figures on the\ncarved screen had leered at her and she hadn't minded. She remembered\ntoo how, whenever they were at the seaside, she had gone off by herself\nand got as close to the sea as she could, and sung something, something\nshe had made up, while she gazed all over that restless water. There had\nbeen this other life, running out, bringing things home in bags, getting\nthings on approval, discussing them with Jug, and taking them back to\nget more things on approval, and arranging father's trays and trying not\nto annoy father. But it all seemed to have happened in a kind of tunnel.\nIt wasn't real. It was only when she came out of the tunnel into the\nmoonlight or by the sea or into a thunderstorm that she really felt\nherself. What did it mean? What was it she was always wanting? What did\nit all lead to? Now? Now?\n\nShe turned away from the Buddha with one of her vague gestures. She went\nover to where Josephine was standing. She wanted to say something to\nJosephine, something frightfully important, about--about the future and\nwhat...\n\n\"Don't you think perhaps--\" she began.\n\nBut Josephine interrupted her. \"I was wondering if now--\" she murmured.\nThey stopped; they waited for each other.\n\n\"Go on, Con,\" said Josephine.\n\n\"No, no, Jug; after you,\" said Constantia.\n\n\"No, say what you were going to say. You began,\" said Josephine.\n\n\"I... I'd rather hear what you were going to say first,\" said Constantia.\n\n\"Don't be absurd, Con.\"\n\n\"Really, Jug.\"\n\n\"Connie!\"\n\n\"Oh, Jug!\"\n\nA pause. Then Constantia said faintly, \"I can't say what I was going to\nsay, Jug, because I've forgotten what it was... that I was going to say.\"\n\nJosephine was silent for a moment. She stared at a big cloud where the\nsun had been. Then she replied shortly, \"I've forgotten too.\"\n\n\n\n\n</CHAPTER>\n"}, {"id": 4, "text": "<CHAPTER>\n4. MR. AND MRS. DOVE.\n\nOf course he knew--no man better--that he hadn't a ghost of a chance,\nhe hadn't an earthly. The very idea of such a thing was preposterous.\nSo preposterous that he'd perfectly understand it if her father--well,\nwhatever her father chose to do he'd perfectly understand. In fact,\nnothing short of desperation, nothing short of the fact that this was\npositively his last day in England for God knows how long, would have\nscrewed him up to it. And even now... He chose a tie out of the chest\nof drawers, a blue and cream check tie, and sat on the side of his bed.\nSupposing she replied, \"What impertinence!\" would he be surprised? Not\nin the least, he decided, turning up his soft collar and turning it down\nover the tie. He expected her to say something like that. He didn't see,\nif he looked at the affair dead soberly, what else she could say.\n\nHere he was! And nervously he tied a bow in front of the mirror, jammed\nhis hair down with both hands, pulled out the flaps of his jacket\npockets. Making between 500 and 600 pounds a year on a fruit farm in--of\nall places--Rhodesia. No capital. Not a penny coming to him. No chance\nof his income increasing for at least four years. As for looks and all\nthat sort of thing, he was completely out of the running. He couldn't\neven boast of top-hole health, for the East Africa business had knocked\nhim out so thoroughly that he'd had to take six months' leave. He was\nstill fearfully pale--worse even than usual this afternoon, he thought,\nbending forward and peering into the mirror. Good heavens! What had\nhappened? His hair looked almost bright green. Dash it all, he hadn't\ngreen hair at all events. That was a bit too steep. And then the green\nlight trembled in the glass; it was the shadow from the tree outside.\nReggie turned away, took out his cigarette case, but remembering how the\nmater hated him to smoke in his bedroom, put it back again and drifted\nover to the chest of drawers. No, he was dashed if he could think of one\nblessed thing in his favour, while she... Ah!... He stopped dead, folded\nhis arms, and leaned hard against the chest of drawers.\n\nAnd in spite of her position, her father's wealth, the fact\nthat she was an only child and far and away the most popular\ngirl in the neighbourhood; in spite of her beauty and her\ncleverness--cleverness!--it was a great deal more than that, there\nwas really nothing she couldn't do; he fully believed, had it been\nnecessary, she would have been a genius at anything--in spite of the\nfact that her parents adored her, and she them, and they'd as soon let\nher go all that way as... In spite of every single thing you could think\nof, so terrific was his love that he couldn't help hoping. Well, was\nit hope? Or was this queer, timid longing to have the chance of looking\nafter her, of making it his job to see that she had everything she\nwanted, and that nothing came near her that wasn't perfect--just love?\nHow he loved her! He squeezed hard against the chest of drawers and\nmurmured to it, \"I love her, I love her!\" And just for the moment he was\nwith her on the way to Umtali. It was night. She sat in a corner asleep.\nHer soft chin was tucked into her soft collar, her gold-brown lashes lay\non her cheeks. He doted on her delicate little nose, her perfect lips,\nher ear like a baby's, and the gold-brown curl that half covered it.\nThey were passing through the jungle. It was warm and dark and far away.\nThen she woke up and said, \"Have I been asleep?\" and he answered, \"Yes.\nAre you all right? Here, let me--\" And he leaned forward to... He bent\nover her. This was such bliss that he could dream no further. But it\ngave him the courage to bound downstairs, to snatch his straw hat from\nthe hall, and to say as he closed the front door, \"Well, I can only try\nmy luck, that's all.\"\n\nBut his luck gave him a nasty jar, to say the least, almost immediately.\nPromenading up and down the garden path with Chinny and Biddy, the\nancient Pekes, was the mater. Of course Reginald was fond of the mater\nand all that. She--she meant well, she had no end of grit, and so on.\nBut there was no denying it, she was rather a grim parent. And there had\nbeen moments, many of them, in Reggie's life, before Uncle Alick died\nand left him the fruit farm, when he was convinced that to be a widow's\nonly son was about the worst punishment a chap could have. And what made\nit rougher than ever was that she was positively all that he had. She\nwasn't only a combined parent, as it were, but she had quarrelled with\nall her own and the governor's relations before Reggie had won his first\ntrouser pockets. So that whenever Reggie was homesick out there, sitting\non his dark veranda by starlight, while the gramophone cried, \"Dear,\nwhat is Life but Love?\" his only vision was of the mater, tall and\nstout, rustling down the garden path, with Chinny and Biddy at her\nheels...\n\nThe mater, with her scissors outspread to snap the head of a dead\nsomething or other, stopped at the sight of Reggie.\n\n\"You are not going out, Reginald?\" she asked, seeing that he was.\n\n\"I'll be back for tea, mater,\" said Reggie weakly, plunging his hands\ninto his jacket pockets.\n\nSnip. Off came a head. Reggie almost jumped.\n\n\"I should have thought you could have spared your mother your last\nafternoon,\" said she.\n\nSilence. The Pekes stared. They understood every word of the mater's.\nBiddy lay down with her tongue poked out; she was so fat and glossy she\nlooked like a lump of half-melted toffee. But Chinny's porcelain eyes\ngloomed at Reginald, and he sniffed faintly, as though the whole world\nwere one unpleasant smell. Snip, went the scissors again. Poor little\nbeggars; they were getting it!\n\n\"And where are you going, if your mother may ask?\" asked the mater.\n\nIt was over at last, but Reggie did not slow down until he was out\nof sight of the house and half-way to Colonel Proctor's. Then only he\nnoticed what a top-hole afternoon it was. It had been raining all the\nmorning, late summer rain, warm, heavy, quick, and now the sky was\nclear, except for a long tail of little clouds, like duckings, sailing\nover the forest. There was just enough wind to shake the last drops off\nthe trees; one warm star splashed on his hand. Ping!--another drummed\non his hat. The empty road gleamed, the hedges smelled of briar, and how\nbig and bright the hollyhocks glowed in the cottage gardens. And here\nwas Colonel Proctor's--here it was already. His hand was on the gate,\nhis elbow jogged the syringa bushes, and petals and pollen scattered\nover his coat sleeve. But wait a bit. This was too quick altogether.\nHe'd meant to think the whole thing out again. Here, steady. But he was\nwalking up the path, with the huge rose bushes on either side. It can't\nbe done like this. But his hand had grasped the bell, given it a pull,\nand started it pealing wildly, as if he'd come to say the house was on\nfire. The housemaid must have been in the hall, too, for the front door\nflashed open, and Reggie was shut in the empty drawing-room before that\nconfounded bell had stopped ringing. Strangely enough, when it did, the\nbig room, shadowy, with some one's parasol lying on top of the grand\npiano, bucked him up--or rather, excited him. It was so quiet, and yet\nin one moment the door would open, and his fate be decided. The feeling\nwas not unlike that of being at the dentist's; he was almost reckless.\nBut at the same time, to his immense surprise, Reggie heard himself\nsaying, \"Lord, Thou knowest, Thou hast not done much for me... \" That\npulled him up; that made him realize again how dead serious it was. Too\nlate. The door handle turned. Anne came in, crossed the shadowy space\nbetween them, gave him her hand, and said, in her small, soft voice,\n\"I'm so sorry, father is out. And mother is having a day in town,\nhat-hunting. There's only me to entertain you, Reggie.\"\n\nReggie gasped, pressed his own hat to his jacket buttons, and stammered\nout, \"As a matter of fact, I've only come... to say good-bye.\"\n\n\"Oh!\" cried Anne softly--she stepped back from him and her grey eyes\ndanced--\"what a very short visit!\"\n\nThen, watching him, her chin tilted, she laughed outright, a long, soft\npeal, and walked away from him over to the piano, and leaned against it,\nplaying with the tassel of the parasol.\n\n\"I'm so sorry,\" she said, \"to be laughing like this. I don't know why I\ndo. It's just a bad ha--habit.\" And suddenly she stamped her grey shoe,\nand took a pocket-handkerchief out of her white woolly jacket. \"I really\nmust conquer it, it's too absurd,\" said she.\n\n\"Good heavens, Anne,\" cried Reggie, \"I love to hear you laughing! I\ncan't imagine anything more--\"\n\nBut the truth was, and they both knew it, she wasn't always laughing;\nit wasn't really a habit. Only ever since the day they'd met, ever since\nthat very first moment, for some strange reason that Reggie wished to\nGod he understood, Anne had laughed at him. Why? It didn't matter where\nthey were or what they were talking about. They might begin by being\nas serious as possible, dead serious--at any rate, as far as he was\nconcerned--but then suddenly, in the middle of a sentence, Anne would\nglance at him, and a little quick quiver passed over her face. Her lips\nparted, her eyes danced, and she began laughing.\n\nAnother queer thing about it was, Reggie had an idea she didn't herself\nknow why she laughed. He had seen her turn away, frown, suck in her\ncheeks, press her hands together. But it was no use. The long, soft peal\nsounded, even while she cried, \"I don't know why I'm laughing.\" It was a\nmystery...\n\nNow she tucked the handkerchief away.\n\n\"Do sit down,\" said she. \"And smoke, won't you? There are cigarettes in\nthat little box beside you. I'll have one too.\" He lighted a match for\nher, and as she bent forward he saw the tiny flame glow in the pearl\nring she wore. \"It is to-morrow that you're going, isn't it?\" said Anne.\n\n\"Yes, to-morrow as ever was,\" said Reggie, and he blew a little fan of\nsmoke. Why on earth was he so nervous? Nervous wasn't the word for it.\n\n\"It's--it's frightfully hard to believe,\" he added.\n\n\"Yes--isn't it?\" said Anne softly, and she leaned forward and rolled\nthe point of her cigarette round the green ash-tray. How beautiful\nshe looked like that!--simply beautiful--and she was so small in that\nimmense chair. Reginald's heart swelled with tenderness, but it was her\nvoice, her soft voice, that made him tremble. \"I feel you've been here\nfor years,\" she said.\n\nReginald took a deep breath of his cigarette. \"It's ghastly, this idea\nof going back,\" he said.\n\n\"Coo-roo-coo-coo-coo,\" sounded from the quiet.\n\n\"But you're fond of being out there, aren't you?\" said Anne. She hooked\nher finger through her pearl necklace. \"Father was saying only the other\nnight how lucky he thought you were to have a life of your own.\" And\nshe looked up at him. Reginald's smile was rather wan. \"I don't feel\nfearfully lucky,\" he said lightly.\n\n\"Roo-coo-coo-coo,\" came again. And Anne murmured, \"You mean it's\nlonely.\"\n\n\"Oh, it isn't the loneliness I care about,\" said Reginald, and he\nstumped his cigarette savagely on the green ash-tray. \"I could stand any\namount of it, used to like it even. It's the idea of--\" Suddenly, to his\nhorror, he felt himself blushing.\n\n\"Roo-coo-coo-coo! Roo-coo-coo-coo!\"\n\nAnne jumped up. \"Come and say good-bye to my doves,\" she said. \"They've\nbeen moved to the side veranda. You do like doves, don't you, Reggie?\"\n\n\"Awfully,\" said Reggie, so fervently that as he opened the French window\nfor her and stood to one side, Anne ran forward and laughed at the doves\ninstead.\n\nTo and fro, to and fro over the fine red sand on the floor of the dove\nhouse, walked the two doves. One was always in front of the other. One\nran forward, uttering a little cry, and the other followed, solemnly\nbowing and bowing. \"You see,\" explained Anne, \"the one in front, she's\nMrs. Dove. She looks at Mr. Dove and gives that little laugh and runs\nforward, and he follows her, bowing and bowing. And that makes her laugh\nagain. Away she runs, and after her,\" cried Anne, and she sat back on\nher heels, \"comes poor Mr. Dove, bowing and bowing... and that's their\nwhole life. They never do anything else, you know.\" She got up and took\nsome yellow grains out of a bag on the roof of the dove house. \"When\nyou think of them, out in Rhodesia, Reggie, you can be sure that is what\nthey will be doing... \"\n\nReggie gave no sign of having seen the doves or of having heard a word.\nFor the moment he was conscious only of the immense effort it took to\ntear his secret out of himself and offer it to Anne. \"Anne, do you think\nyou could ever care for me?\" It was done. It was over. And in the little\npause that followed Reginald saw the garden open to the light, the blue\nquivering sky, the flutter of leaves on the veranda poles, and Anne\nturning over the grains of maize on her palm with one finger. Then\nslowly she shut her hand, and the new world faded as she murmured\nslowly, \"No, never in that way.\" But he had scarcely time to feel\nanything before she walked quickly away, and he followed her down the\nsteps, along the garden path, under the pink rose arches, across the\nlawn. There, with the gay herbaceous border behind her, Anne faced\nReginald. \"It isn't that I'm not awfully fond of you,\" she said. \"I\nam. But\"--her eyes widened--\"not in the way\"--a quiver passed over her\nface--\"one ought to be fond of--\" Her lips parted, and she couldn't stop\nherself. She began laughing. \"There, you see, you see,\" she cried, \"it's\nyour check t-tie. Even at this moment, when one would think one really\nwould be solemn, your tie reminds me fearfully of the bow-tie that cats\nwear in pictures! Oh, please forgive me for being so horrid, please!\"\n\nReggie caught hold of her little warm hand. \"There's no question of\nforgiving you,\" he said quickly. \"How could there be? And I do believe I\nknow why I make you laugh. It's because you're so far above me in every\nway that I am somehow ridiculous. I see that, Anne. But if I were to--\"\n\n\"No, no.\" Anne squeezed his hand hard. \"It's not that. That's all wrong.\nI'm not far above you at all. You're much better than I am. You're\nmarvellously unselfish and... and kind and simple. I'm none of those\nthings. You don't know me. I'm the most awful character,\" said Anne.\n\"Please don't interrupt. And besides, that's not the point. The point\nis\"--she shook her head--\"I couldn't possibly marry a man I laughed at.\nSurely you see that. The man I marry--\" breathed Anne softly. She broke\noff. She drew her hand away, and looking at Reggie she smiled strangely,\ndreamily. \"The man I marry--\"\n\nAnd it seemed to Reggie that a tall, handsome, brilliant stranger\nstepped in front of him and took his place--the kind of man that Anne\nand he had seen often at the theatre, walking on to the stage from\nnowhere, without a word catching the heroine in his arms, and after one\nlong, tremendous look, carrying her off to anywhere...\n\nReggie bowed to his vision. \"Yes, I see,\" he said huskily.\n\n\"Do you?\" said Anne. \"Oh, I do hope you do. Because I feel so horrid\nabout it. It's so hard to explain. You know I've never--\" She stopped.\nReggie looked at her. She was smiling. \"Isn't it funny?\" she said.\n\"I can say anything to you. I always have been able to from the very\nbeginning.\"\n\nHe tried to smile, to say \"I'm glad.\" She went on. \"I've never known any\none I like as much as I like you. I've never felt so happy with any one.\nBut I'm sure it's not what people and what books mean when they talk\nabout love. Do you understand? Oh, if you only knew how horrid I feel.\nBut we'd be like... like Mr. and Mrs. Dove.\"\n\nThat did it. That seemed to Reginald final, and so terribly true that he\ncould hardly bear it. \"Don't drive it home,\" he said, and he turned away\nfrom Anne and looked across the lawn. There was the gardener's cottage,\nwith the dark ilex-tree beside it. A wet, blue thumb of transparent\nsmoke hung above the chimney. It didn't look real. How his throat\nached! Could he speak? He had a shot. \"I must be getting along home,\" he\ncroaked, and he began walking across the lawn. But Anne ran after him.\n\"No, don't. You can't go yet,\" she said imploringly. \"You can't possibly\ngo away feeling like that.\" And she stared up at him frowning, biting\nher lip.\n\n\"Oh, that's all right,\" said Reggie, giving himself a shake. \"I'll...\nI'll--\" And he waved his hand as much to say \"get over it.\"\n\n\"But this is awful,\" said Anne. She clasped her hands and stood in front\nof him. \"Surely you do see how fatal it would be for us to marry, don't\nyou?\"\n\n\"Oh, quite, quite,\" said Reggie, looking at her with haggard eyes.\n\n\"How wrong, how wicked, feeling as I do. I mean, it's all very well for\nMr. and Mrs. Dove. But imagine that in real life--imagine it!\"\n\n\"Oh, absolutely,\" said Reggie, and he started to walk on. But again Anne\nstopped him. She tugged at his sleeve, and to his astonishment, this\ntime, instead of laughing, she looked like a little girl who was going\nto cry.\n\n\"Then why, if you understand, are you so un-unhappy?\" she wailed. \"Why\ndo you mind so fearfully? Why do you look so aw-awful?\"\n\nReggie gulped, and again he waved something away. \"I can't help it,\" he\nsaid, \"I've had a blow. If I cut off now, I'll be able to--\"\n\n\"How can you talk of cutting off now?\" said Anne scornfully. She stamped\nher foot at Reggie; she was crimson. \"How can you be so cruel? I can't\nlet you go until I know for certain that you are just as happy as you\nwere before you asked me to marry you. Surely you must see that, it's so\nsimple.\"\n\nBut it did not seem at all simple to Reginald. It seemed impossibly\ndifficult.\n\n\"Even if I can't marry you, how can I know that you're all that\nway away, with only that awful mother to write to, and that you're\nmiserable, and that it's all my fault?\"\n\n\"It's not your fault. Don't think that. It's just fate.\" Reggie took her\nhand off his sleeve and kissed it. \"Don't pity me, dear little Anne,\" he\nsaid gently. And this time he nearly ran, under the pink arches, along\nthe garden path.\n\n\"Roo-coo-coo-coo! Roo-coo-coo-coo!\" sounded from the veranda. \"Reggie,\nReggie,\" from the garden.\n\nHe stopped, he turned. But when she saw his timid, puzzled look, she\ngave a little laugh.\n\n\"Come back, Mr. Dove,\" said Anne. And Reginald came slowly across the\nlawn.\n\n\n\n\n</CHAPTER>\n"}, {"id": 5, "text": "<CHAPTER>\n5. THE YOUNG GIRL.\n\nIn her blue dress, with her cheeks lightly flushed, her blue, blue eyes,\nand her gold curls pinned up as though for the first time--pinned up\nto be out of the way for her flight--Mrs. Raddick's daughter might have\njust dropped from this radiant heaven. Mrs. Raddick's timid, faintly\nastonished, but deeply admiring glance looked as if she believed it,\ntoo; but the daughter didn't appear any too pleased--why should she?--to\nhave alighted on the steps of the Casino. Indeed, she was bored--bored\nas though Heaven had been full of casinos with snuffy old saints for\ncroupiers and crowns to play with.\n\n\"You don't mind taking Hennie?\" said Mrs. Raddick. \"Sure you don't?\nThere's the car, and you'll have tea and we'll be back here on this\nstep--right here--in an hour. You see, I want her to go in. She's not\nbeen before, and it's worth seeing. I feel it wouldn't be fair to her.\"\n\n\"Oh, shut up, mother,\" said she wearily. \"Come along. Don't talk so\nmuch. And your bag's open; you'll be losing all your money again.\"\n\n\"I'm sorry, darling,\" said Mrs. Raddick.\n\n\"Oh, do come in! I want to make money,\" said the impatient voice. \"It's\nall jolly well for you--but I'm broke!\"\n\n\"Here--take fifty francs, darling, take a hundred!\" I saw Mrs. Raddick\npressing notes into her hand as they passed through the swing doors.\n\nHennie and I stood on the steps a minute, watching the people. He had a\nvery broad, delighted smile.\n\n\"I say,\" he cried, \"there's an English bulldog. Are they allowed to take\ndogs in there?\"\n\n\"No, they're not.\"\n\n\"He's a ripping chap, isn't he? I wish I had one. They're such fun. They\nfrighten people so, and they're never fierce with their--the people they\nbelong to.\" Suddenly he squeezed my arm. \"I say, do look at that old\nwoman. Who is she? Why does she look like that? Is she a gambler?\"\n\nThe ancient, withered creature, wearing a green satin dress, a black\nvelvet cloak and a white hat with purple feathers, jerked slowly, slowly\nup the steps as though she were being drawn up on wires. She stared in\nfront of her, she was laughing and nodding and cackling to herself; her\nclaws clutched round what looked like a dirty boot-bag.\n\nBut just at that moment there was Mrs. Raddick again with--her--and\nanother lady hovering in the background. Mrs. Raddick rushed at me. She\nwas brightly flushed, gay, a different creature. She was like a woman\nwho is saying \"good-bye\" to her friends on the station platform, with\nnot a minute to spare before the train starts.\n\n\"Oh, you're here, still. Isn't that lucky! You've not gone. Isn't that\nfine! I've had the most dreadful time with--her,\" and she waved to\nher daughter, who stood absolutely still, disdainful, looking down,\ntwiddling her foot on the step, miles away. \"They won't let her in. I\nswore she was twenty-one. But they won't believe me. I showed the man\nmy purse; I didn't dare to do more. But it was no use. He simply\nscoffed... And now I've just met Mrs. MacEwen from New York, and she just\nwon thirteen thousand in the Salle Privee--and she wants me to go back\nwith her while the luck lasts. Of course I can't leave--her. But if\nyou'd--\"\n\nAt that \"she\" looked up; she simply withered her mother. \"Why can't\nyou leave me?\" she said furiously. \"What utter rot! How dare you make\na scene like this? This is the last time I'll come out with you. You\nreally are too awful for words.\" She looked her mother up and down.\n\"Calm yourself,\" she said superbly.\n\nMrs. Raddick was desperate, just desperate. She was \"wild\" to go back\nwith Mrs. MacEwen, but at the same time...\n\nI seized my courage. \"Would you--do you care to come to tea with--us?\"\n\n\"Yes, yes, she'll be delighted. That's just what I wanted, isn't it,\ndarling? Mrs. MacEwen... I'll be back here in an hour... or less... I'll--\"\n\nMrs. R. dashed up the steps. I saw her bag was open again.\n\nSo we three were left. But really it wasn't my fault. Hennie looked\ncrushed to the earth, too. When the car was there she wrapped her dark\ncoat round her--to escape contamination. Even her little feet looked as\nthough they scorned to carry her down the steps to us.\n\n\"I am so awfully sorry,\" I murmured as the car started.\n\n\"Oh, I don't mind,\" said she. \"I don't want to look twenty-one. Who\nwould--if they were seventeen! It's\"--and she gave a faint shudder--\"the\nstupidity I loathe, and being stared at by old fat men. Beasts!\"\n\nHennie gave her a quick look and then peered out of the window.\n\nWe drew up before an immense palace of pink-and-white marble with\norange-trees outside the doors in gold-and-black tubs.\n\n\"Would you care to go in?\" I suggested.\n\nShe hesitated, glanced, bit her lip, and resigned herself. \"Oh well,\nthere seems nowhere else,\" said she. \"Get out, Hennie.\"\n\nI went first--to find the table, of course--she followed. But the worst\nof it was having her little brother, who was only twelve, with us. That\nwas the last, final straw--having that child, trailing at her heels.\n\nThere was one table. It had pink carnations and pink plates with little\nblue tea-napkins for sails.\n\n\"Shall we sit here?\"\n\nShe put her hand wearily on the back of a white wicker chair.\n\n\"We may as well. Why not?\" said she.\n\nHennie squeezed past her and wriggled on to a stool at the end. He felt\nawfully out of it. She didn't even take her gloves off. She lowered her\neyes and drummed on the table. When a faint violin sounded she winced\nand bit her lip again. Silence.\n\nThe waitress appeared. I hardly dared to ask her. \"Tea--coffee? China\ntea--or iced tea with lemon?\"\n\nReally she didn't mind. It was all the same to her. She didn't really\nwant anything. Hennie whispered, \"Chocolate!\"\n\nBut just as the waitress turned away she cried out carelessly, \"Oh, you\nmay as well bring me a chocolate, too.\"\n\nWhile we waited she took out a little, gold powder-box with a mirror in\nthe lid, shook the poor little puff as though she loathed it, and dabbed\nher lovely nose.\n\n\"Hennie,\" she said, \"take those flowers away.\" She pointed with her puff\nto the carnations, and I heard her murmur, \"I can't bear flowers on\na table.\" They had evidently been giving her intense pain, for she\npositively closed her eyes as I moved them away.\n\nThe waitress came back with the chocolate and the tea. She put the\nbig, frothing cups before them and pushed across my clear glass. Hennie\nburied his nose, emerged, with, for one dreadful moment, a little\ntrembling blob of cream on the tip. But he hastily wiped it off like a\nlittle gentleman. I wondered if I should dare draw her attention to\nher cup. She didn't notice it--didn't see it--until suddenly, quite by\nchance, she took a sip. I watched anxiously; she faintly shuddered.\n\n\"Dreadfully sweet!\" said she.\n\nA tiny boy with a head like a raisin and a chocolate body came\nround with a tray of pastries--row upon row of little freaks, little\ninspirations, little melting dreams. He offered them to her. \"Oh, I'm\nnot at all hungry. Take them away.\"\n\nHe offered them to Hennie. Hennie gave me a swift look--it must have\nbeen satisfactory--for he took a chocolate cream, a coffee eclair,\na meringue stuffed with chestnut and a tiny horn filled with fresh\nstrawberries. She could hardly bear to watch him. But just as the boy\nswerved away she held up her plate.\n\n\"Oh well, give me one,\" said she.\n\nThe silver tongs dropped one, two, three--and a cherry tartlet. \"I don't\nknow why you're giving me all these,\" she said, and nearly smiled. \"I\nshan't eat them; I couldn't!\"\n\nI felt much more comfortable. I sipped my tea, leaned back, and even\nasked if I might smoke. At that she paused, the fork in her hand, opened\nher eyes, and really did smile. \"Of course,\" said she. \"I always expect\npeople to.\"\n\nBut at that moment a tragedy happened to Hennie. He speared his pastry\nhorn too hard, and it flew in two, and one half spilled on the table.\nGhastly affair! He turned crimson. Even his ears flared, and one ashamed\nhand crept across the table to take what was left of the body away.\n\n\"You utter little beast!\" said she.\n\nGood heavens! I had to fly to the rescue. I cried hastily, \"Will you be\nabroad long?\"\n\nBut she had already forgotten Hennie. I was forgotten, too. She was\ntrying to remember something... She was miles away.\n\n\"I--don't--know,\" she said slowly, from that far place.\n\n\"I suppose you prefer it to London. It's more--more--\"\n\nWhen I didn't go on she came back and looked at me, very puzzled.\n\"More--?\"\n\n\"Enfin--gayer,\" I cried, waving my cigarette.\n\nBut that took a whole cake to consider. Even then, \"Oh well, that\ndepends!\" was all she could safely say.\n\nHennie had finished. He was still very warm.\n\nI seized the butterfly list off the table. \"I say--what about an ice,\nHennie? What about tangerine and ginger? No, something cooler. What\nabout a fresh pineapple cream?\"\n\nHennie strongly approved. The waitress had her eye on us. The order was\ntaken when she looked up from her crumbs.\n\n\"Did you say tangerine and ginger? I like ginger. You can bring me one.\"\nAnd then quickly, \"I wish that orchestra wouldn't play things from\nthe year One. We were dancing to that all last Christmas. It's too\nsickening!\"\n\nBut it was a charming air. Now that I noticed it, it warmed me.\n\n\"I think this is rather a nice place, don't you, Hennie?\" I said.\n\nHennie said: \"Ripping!\" He meant to say it very low, but it came out\nvery high in a kind of squeak.\n\nNice? This place? Nice? For the first time she stared about her, trying\nto see what there was... She blinked; her lovely eyes wondered. A very\ngood-looking elderly man stared back at her through a monocle on a black\nribbon. But him she simply couldn't see. There was a hole in the air\nwhere he was. She looked through and through him.\n\nFinally the little flat spoons lay still on the glass plates. Hennie\nlooked rather exhausted, but she pulled on her white gloves again. She\nhad some trouble with her diamond wrist-watch; it got in her way. She\ntugged at it--tried to break the stupid little thing--it wouldn't break.\nFinally, she had to drag her glove over. I saw, after that, she couldn't\nstand this place a moment longer, and, indeed, she jumped up and turned\naway while I went through the vulgar act of paying for the tea.\n\nAnd then we were outside again. It had grown dusky. The sky was\nsprinkled with small stars; the big lamps glowed. While we waited for\nthe car to come up she stood on the step, just as before, twiddling her\nfoot, looking down.\n\nHennie bounded forward to open the door and she got in and sank back\nwith--oh--such a sigh!\n\n\"Tell him,\" she gasped, \"to drive as fast as he can.\"\n\nHennie grinned at his friend the chauffeur. \"Allie veet!\" said he. Then\nhe composed himself and sat on the small seat facing us.\n\nThe gold powder-box came out again. Again the poor little puff was\nshaken; again there was that swift, deadly-secret glance between her and\nthe mirror.\n\nWe tore through the black-and-gold town like a pair of scissors tearing\nthrough brocade. Hennie had great difficulty not to look as though he\nwere hanging on to something.\n\nAnd when we reached the Casino, of course Mrs. Raddick wasn't there.\nThere wasn't a sign of her on the steps--not a sign.\n\n\"Will you stay in the car while I go and look?\"\n\nBut no--she wouldn't do that. Good heavens, no! Hennie could stay. She\ncouldn't bear sitting in a car. She'd wait on the steps.\n\n\"But I scarcely like to leave you,\" I murmured. \"I'd very much rather\nnot leave you here.\"\n\nAt that she threw back her coat; she turned and faced me; her lips\nparted. \"Good heavens--why! I--I don't mind it a bit. I--I like\nwaiting.\" And suddenly her cheeks crimsoned, her eyes grew dark--for\na moment I thought she was going to cry. \"L--let me, please,\" she\nstammered, in a warm, eager voice. \"I like it. I love waiting!\nReally--really I do! I'm always waiting--in all kinds of places... \"\n\nHer dark coat fell open, and her white throat--all her soft young body\nin the blue dress--was like a flower that is just emerging from its dark\nbud.\n\n\n\n\n</CHAPTER>\n"}, {"id": 6, "text": "<CHAPTER>\n6. LIFE OF MA PARKER.\n\nWhen the literary gentleman, whose flat old Ma Parker cleaned every\nTuesday, opened the door to her that morning, he asked after her\ngrandson. Ma Parker stood on the doormat inside the dark little hall,\nand she stretched out her hand to help her gentleman shut the door\nbefore she replied. \"We buried 'im yesterday, sir,\" she said quietly.\n\n\"Oh, dear me! I'm sorry to hear that,\" said the literary gentleman in\na shocked tone. He was in the middle of his breakfast. He wore a very\nshabby dressing-gown and carried a crumpled newspaper in one hand.\nBut he felt awkward. He could hardly go back to the warm sitting-room\nwithout saying something--something more. Then because these people set\nsuch store by funerals he said kindly, \"I hope the funeral went off all\nright.\"\n\n\"Beg parding, sir?\" said old Ma Parker huskily.\n\nPoor old bird! She did look dashed. \"I hope the funeral was\na--a--success,\" said he. Ma Parker gave no answer. She bent her head\nand hobbled off to the kitchen, clasping the old fish bag that held\nher cleaning things and an apron and a pair of felt shoes. The literary\ngentleman raised his eyebrows and went back to his breakfast.\n\n\"Overcome, I suppose,\" he said aloud, helping himself to the marmalade.\n\nMa Parker drew the two jetty spears out of her toque and hung it behind\nthe door. She unhooked her worn jacket and hung that up too. Then she\ntied her apron and sat down to take off her boots. To take off her boots\nor to put them on was an agony to her, but it had been an agony for\nyears. In fact, she was so accustomed to the pain that her face was\ndrawn and screwed up ready for the twinge before she'd so much as untied\nthe laces. That over, she sat back with a sigh and softly rubbed her\nknees...\n\n\"Gran! Gran!\" Her little grandson stood on her lap in his button boots.\nHe'd just come in from playing in the street.\n\n\"Look what a state you've made your gran's skirt into--you wicked boy!\"\n\nBut he put his arms round her neck and rubbed his cheek against hers.\n\n\"Gran, gi' us a penny!\" he coaxed.\n\n\"Be off with you; Gran ain't got no pennies.\"\n\n\"Yes, you 'ave.\"\n\n\"No, I ain't.\"\n\n\"Yes, you 'ave. Gi' us one!\"\n\nAlready she was feeling for the old, squashed, black leather purse.\n\n\"Well, what'll you give your gran?\"\n\nHe gave a shy little laugh and pressed closer. She felt his eyelid\nquivering against her cheek. \"I ain't got nothing,\" he murmured...\n\nThe old woman sprang up, seized the iron kettle off the gas stove and\ntook it over to the sink. The noise of the water drumming in the\nkettle deadened her pain, it seemed. She filled the pail, too, and the\nwashing-up bowl.\n\nIt would take a whole book to describe the state of that kitchen. During\nthe week the literary gentleman \"did\" for himself. That is to say, he\nemptied the tea leaves now and again into a jam jar set aside for that\npurpose, and if he ran out of clean forks he wiped over one or two\non the roller towel. Otherwise, as he explained to his friends, his\n\"system\" was quite simple, and he couldn't understand why people made\nall this fuss about housekeeping.\n\n\"You simply dirty everything you've got, get a hag in once a week to\nclean up, and the thing's done.\"\n\nThe result looked like a gigantic dustbin. Even the floor was littered\nwith toast crusts, envelopes, cigarette ends. But Ma Parker bore him no\ngrudge. She pitied the poor young gentleman for having no one to look\nafter him. Out of the smudgy little window you could see an immense\nexpanse of sad-looking sky, and whenever there were clouds they looked\nvery worn, old clouds, frayed at the edges, with holes in them, or dark\nstains like tea.\n\nWhile the water was heating, Ma Parker began sweeping the floor. \"Yes,\"\nshe thought, as the broom knocked, \"what with one thing and another I've\nhad my share. I've had a hard life.\"\n\nEven the neighbours said that of her. Many a time, hobbling home with\nher fish bag she heard them, waiting at the corner, or leaning over\nthe area railings, say among themselves, \"She's had a hard life, has Ma\nParker.\" And it was so true she wasn't in the least proud of it. It was\njust as if you were to say she lived in the basement-back at Number 27.\nA hard life!...\n\nAt sixteen she'd left Stratford and come up to London as kitching-maid.\nYes, she was born in Stratford-on-Avon. Shakespeare, sir? No, people\nwere always arsking her about him. But she'd never heard his name until\nshe saw it on the theatres.\n\nNothing remained of Stratford except that \"sitting in the fire-place\nof a evening you could see the stars through the chimley,\" and \"Mother\nalways 'ad 'er side of bacon, 'anging from the ceiling.\" And there was\nsomething--a bush, there was--at the front door, that smelt ever so\nnice. But the bush was very vague. She'd only remembered it once or\ntwice in the hospital, when she'd been taken bad.\n\nThat was a dreadful place--her first place. She was never allowed out.\nShe never went upstairs except for prayers morning and evening. It was a\nfair cellar. And the cook was a cruel woman. She used to snatch away her\nletters from home before she'd read them, and throw them in the range\nbecause they made her dreamy... And the beedles! Would you believe\nit?--until she came to London she'd never seen a black beedle. Here Ma\nalways gave a little laugh, as though--not to have seen a black beedle!\nWell! It was as if to say you'd never seen your own feet.\n\nWhen that family was sold up she went as \"help\" to a doctor's house, and\nafter two years there, on the run from morning till night, she married\nher husband. He was a baker.\n\n\"A baker, Mrs. Parker!\" the literary gentleman would say. For\noccasionally he laid aside his tomes and lent an ear, at least, to this\nproduct called Life. \"It must be rather nice to be married to a baker!\"\n\nMrs. Parker didn't look so sure.\n\n\"Such a clean trade,\" said the gentleman.\n\nMrs. Parker didn't look convinced.\n\n\"And didn't you like handing the new loaves to the customers?\"\n\n\"Well, sir,\" said Mrs. Parker, \"I wasn't in the shop above a great deal.\nWe had thirteen little ones and buried seven of them. If it wasn't the\n'ospital it was the infirmary, you might say!\"\n\n\"You might, indeed, Mrs. Parker!\" said the gentleman, shuddering, and\ntaking up his pen again.\n\nYes, seven had gone, and while the six were still small her husband was\ntaken ill with consumption. It was flour on the lungs, the doctor told\nher at the time... Her husband sat up in bed with his shirt pulled over\nhis head, and the doctor's finger drew a circle on his back.\n\n\"Now, if we were to cut him open here, Mrs. Parker,\" said the doctor,\n\"you'd find his lungs chock-a-block with white powder. Breathe, my\ngood fellow!\" And Mrs. Parker never knew for certain whether she saw or\nwhether she fancied she saw a great fan of white dust come out of her\npoor dead husband's lips...\n\nBut the struggle she'd had to bring up those six little children and\nkeep herself to herself. Terrible it had been! Then, just when they were\nold enough to go to school her husband's sister came to stop with them\nto help things along, and she hadn't been there more than two months\nwhen she fell down a flight of steps and hurt her spine. And for five\nyears Ma Parker had another baby--and such a one for crying!--to look\nafter. Then young Maudie went wrong and took her sister Alice with her;\nthe two boys emigrated, and young Jim went to India with the army, and\nEthel, the youngest, married a good-for-nothing little waiter who died\nof ulcers the year little Lennie was born. And now little Lennie--my\ngrandson...\n\nThe piles of dirty cups, dirty dishes, were washed and dried. The\nink-black knives were cleaned with a piece of potato and finished off\nwith a piece of cork. The table was scrubbed, and the dresser and the\nsink that had sardine tails swimming in it...\n\nHe'd never been a strong child--never from the first. He'd been one of\nthose fair babies that everybody took for a girl. Silvery fair curls he\nhad, blue eyes, and a little freckle like a diamond on one side of his\nnose. The trouble she and Ethel had had to rear that child! The things\nout of the newspapers they tried him with! Every Sunday morning Ethel\nwould read aloud while Ma Parker did her washing.\n\n\"Dear Sir,--Just a line to let you know my little Myrtil was laid out\nfor dead... After four bottils... gained 8 lbs. in 9 weeks, and is still\nputting it on.\"\n\nAnd then the egg-cup of ink would come off the dresser and the letter\nwould be written, and Ma would buy a postal order on her way to work\nnext morning. But it was no use. Nothing made little Lennie put it\non. Taking him to the cemetery, even, never gave him a colour; a nice\nshake-up in the bus never improved his appetite.\n\nBut he was gran's boy from the first...\n\n\"Whose boy are you?\" said old Ma Parker, straightening up from the stove\nand going over to the smudgy window. And a little voice, so warm, so\nclose, it half stifled her--it seemed to be in her breast under her\nheart--laughed out, and said, \"I'm gran's boy!\"\n\nAt that moment there was a sound of steps, and the literary gentleman\nappeared, dressed for walking.\n\n\"Oh, Mrs. Parker, I'm going out.\"\n\n\"Very good, sir.\"\n\n\"And you'll find your half-crown in the tray of the inkstand.\"\n\n\"Thank you, sir.\"\n\n\"Oh, by the way, Mrs. Parker,\" said the literary gentleman quickly, \"you\ndidn't throw away any cocoa last time you were here--did you?\"\n\n\"No, sir.\" \"Very strange. I could have sworn I left a teaspoonful of\ncocoa in the tin.\" He broke off. He said softly and firmly, \"You'll\nalways tell me when you throw things away--won't you, Mrs. Parker?\" And\nhe walked off very well pleased with himself, convinced, in fact,\nhe'd shown Mrs. Parker that under his apparent carelessness he was as\nvigilant as a woman.\n\nThe door banged. She took her brushes and cloths into the bedroom. But\nwhen she began to make the bed, smoothing, tucking, patting, the thought\nof little Lennie was unbearable. Why did he have to suffer so? That's\nwhat she couldn't understand. Why should a little angel child have to\narsk for his breath and fight for it? There was no sense in making a\nchild suffer like that.\n\n... From Lennie's little box of a chest there came a sound as though\nsomething was boiling. There was a great lump of something bubbling in\nhis chest that he couldn't get rid of. When he coughed the sweat sprang\nout on his head; his eyes bulged, his hands waved, and the great lump\nbubbled as a potato knocks in a saucepan. But what was more awful than\nall was when he didn't cough he sat against the pillow and never spoke\nor answered, or even made as if he heard. Only he looked offended.\n\n\"It's not your poor old gran's doing it, my lovey,\" said old Ma Parker,\npatting back the damp hair from his little scarlet ears. But Lennie\nmoved his head and edged away. Dreadfully offended with her he\nlooked--and solemn. He bent his head and looked at her sideways as\nthough he couldn't have believed it of his gran.\n\nBut at the last... Ma Parker threw the counterpane over the bed. No, she\nsimply couldn't think about it. It was too much--she'd had too much\nin her life to bear. She'd borne it up till now, she'd kept herself\nto herself, and never once had she been seen to cry. Never by a living\nsoul. Not even her own children had seen Ma break down. She'd kept a\nproud face always. But now! Lennie gone--what had she? She had nothing.\nHe was all she'd got from life, and now he was took too. Why must it\nall have happened to me? she wondered. \"What have I done?\" said old Ma\nParker. \"What have I done?\"\n\nAs she said those words she suddenly let fall her brush. She found\nherself in the kitchen. Her misery was so terrible that she pinned on\nher hat, put on her jacket and walked out of the flat like a person in\na dream. She did not know what she was doing. She was like a person so\ndazed by the horror of what has happened that he walks away--anywhere,\nas though by walking away he could escape...\n\nIt was cold in the street. There was a wind like ice. People went\nflitting by, very fast; the men walked like scissors; the women trod\nlike cats. And nobody knew--nobody cared. Even if she broke down, if at\nlast, after all these years, she were to cry, she'd find herself in the\nlock-up as like as not.\n\nBut at the thought of crying it was as though little Lennie leapt in\nhis gran's arms. Ah, that's what she wants to do, my dove. Gran wants\nto cry. If she could only cry now, cry for a long time, over everything,\nbeginning with her first place and the cruel cook, going on to the\ndoctor's, and then the seven little ones, death of her husband, the\nchildren's leaving her, and all the years of misery that led up to\nLennie. But to have a proper cry over all these things would take a\nlong time. All the same, the time for it had come. She must do it. She\ncouldn't put it off any longer; she couldn't wait any more... Where could\nshe go?\n\n\"She's had a hard life, has Ma Parker.\" Yes, a hard life, indeed! Her\nchin began to tremble; there was no time to lose. But where? Where?\n\nShe couldn't go home; Ethel was there. It would frighten Ethel out\nof her life. She couldn't sit on a bench anywhere; people would come\narsking her questions. She couldn't possibly go back to the gentleman's\nflat; she had no right to cry in strangers' houses. If she sat on some\nsteps a policeman would speak to her.\n\nOh, wasn't there anywhere where she could hide and keep herself to\nherself and stay as long as she liked, not disturbing anybody, and\nnobody worrying her? Wasn't there anywhere in the world where she could\nhave her cry out--at last?\n\nMa Parker stood, looking up and down. The icy wind blew out her apron\ninto a balloon. And now it began to rain. There was nowhere.\n\n\n\n\n</CHAPTER>\n"}, {"id": 7, "text": "<CHAPTER>\n7. MARRIAGE A LA MODE.\n\nOn his way to the station William remembered with a fresh pang of\ndisappointment that he was taking nothing down to the kiddies. Poor\nlittle chaps! It was hard lines on them. Their first words always were\nas they ran to greet him, \"What have you got for me, daddy?\" and he had\nnothing. He would have to buy them some sweets at the station. But that\nwas what he had done for the past four Saturdays; their faces had fallen\nlast time when they saw the same old boxes produced again.\n\nAnd Paddy had said, \"I had red ribbing on mine bee-fore!\"\n\nAnd Johnny had said, \"It's always pink on mine. I hate pink.\"\n\nBut what was William to do? The affair wasn't so easily settled. In the\nold days, of course, he would have taken a taxi off to a decent toyshop\nand chosen them something in five minutes. But nowadays they had Russian\ntoys, French toys, Serbian toys--toys from God knows where. It was over\na year since Isabel had scrapped the old donkeys and engines and so on\nbecause they were so \"dreadfully sentimental\" and \"so appallingly bad\nfor the babies' sense of form.\"\n\n\"It's so important,\" the new Isabel had explained, \"that they should\nlike the right things from the very beginning. It saves so much time\nlater on. Really, if the poor pets have to spend their infant years\nstaring at these horrors, one can imagine them growing up and asking to\nbe taken to the Royal Academy.\"\n\nAnd she spoke as though a visit to the Royal Academy was certain\nimmediate death to any one...\n\n\"Well, I don't know,\" said William slowly. \"When I was their age I used\nto go to bed hugging an old towel with a knot in it.\"\n\nThe new Isabel looked at him, her eyes narrowed, her lips apart.\n\n\"Dear William! I'm sure you did!\" She laughed in the new way.\n\nSweets it would have to be, however, thought William gloomily, fishing\nin his pocket for change for the taxi-man. And he saw the kiddies\nhanding the boxes round--they were awfully generous little chaps--while\nIsabel's precious friends didn't hesitate to help themselves...\n\nWhat about fruit? William hovered before a stall just inside the\nstation. What about a melon each? Would they have to share that, too?\nOr a pineapple, for Pad, and a melon for Johnny? Isabel's friends could\nhardly go sneaking up to the nursery at the children's meal-times. All\nthe same, as he bought the melon William had a horrible vision of one\nof Isabel's young poets lapping up a slice, for some reason, behind the\nnursery door.\n\nWith his two very awkward parcels he strode off to his train. The\nplatform was crowded, the train was in. Doors banged open and shut.\nThere came such a loud hissing from the engine that people looked dazed\nas they scurried to and fro. William made straight for a first-class\nsmoker, stowed away his suit-case and parcels, and taking a huge wad of\npapers out of his inner pocket, he flung down in the corner and began to\nread.\n\n\"Our client moreover is positive... We are inclined to reconsider... in\nthe event of--\" Ah, that was better. William pressed back his flattened\nhair and stretched his legs across the carriage floor. The familiar dull\ngnawing in his breast quietened down. \"With regard to our decision--\" He\ntook out a blue pencil and scored a paragraph slowly.\n\nTwo men came in, stepped across him, and made for the farther corner. A\nyoung fellow swung his golf clubs into the rack and sat down opposite.\nThe train gave a gentle lurch, they were off. William glanced up and saw\nthe hot, bright station slipping away. A red-faced girl raced along by\nthe carriages, there was something strained and almost desperate in the\nway she waved and called. \"Hysterical!\" thought William dully. Then a\ngreasy, black-faced workman at the end of the platform grinned at the\npassing train. And William thought, \"A filthy life!\" and went back to\nhis papers.\n\nWhen he looked up again there were fields, and beasts standing for\nshelter under the dark trees. A wide river, with naked children\nsplashing in the shallows, glided into sight and was gone again. The sky\nshone pale, and one bird drifted high like a dark fleck in a jewel.\n\n\"We have examined our client's correspondence files... \" The last\nsentence he had read echoed in his mind. \"We have examined... \" William\nhung on to that sentence, but it was no good; it snapped in the\nmiddle, and the fields, the sky, the sailing bird, the water, all said,\n\"Isabel.\" The same thing happened every Saturday afternoon. When he\nwas on his way to meet Isabel there began those countless imaginary\nmeetings. She was at the station, standing just a little apart from\neverybody else; she was sitting in the open taxi outside; she was at\nthe garden gate; walking across the parched grass; at the door, or just\ninside the hall.\n\nAnd her clear, light voice said, \"It's William,\" or \"Hillo, William!\" or\n\"So William has come!\" He touched her cool hand, her cool cheek.\n\nThe exquisite freshness of Isabel! When he had been a little boy, it was\nhis delight to run into the garden after a shower of rain and shake the\nrose-bush over him. Isabel was that rose-bush, petal-soft, sparkling and\ncool. And he was still that little boy. But there was no running into\nthe garden now, no laughing and shaking. The dull, persistent gnawing in\nhis breast started again. He drew up his legs, tossed the papers aside,\nand shut his eyes.\n\n\"What is it, Isabel? What is it?\" he said tenderly. They were in their\nbedroom in the new house. Isabel sat on a painted stool before the\ndressing-table that was strewn with little black and green boxes.\n\n\"What is what, William?\" And she bent forward, and her fine light hair\nfell over her cheeks.\n\n\"Ah, you know!\" He stood in the middle of the room and he felt a\nstranger. At that Isabel wheeled round quickly and faced him.\n\n\"Oh, William!\" she cried imploringly, and she held up the hair-brush:\n\"Please! Please don't be so dreadfully stuffy and--tragic. You're always\nsaying or looking or hinting that I've changed. Just because I've got to\nknow really congenial people, and go about more, and am frightfully keen\non--on everything, you behave as though I'd--\" Isabel tossed back\nher hair and laughed--\"killed our love or something. It's so awfully\nabsurd\"--she bit her lip--\"and it's so maddening, William. Even this new\nhouse and the servants you grudge me.\"\n\n\"Isabel!\"\n\n\"Yes, yes, it's true in a way,\" said Isabel quickly. \"You think they are\nanother bad sign. Oh, I know you do. I feel it,\" she said softly, \"every\ntime you come up the stairs. But we couldn't have gone on living in\nthat other poky little hole, William. Be practical, at least! Why, there\nwasn't enough room for the babies even.\"\n\nNo, it was true. Every morning when he came back from chambers it was to\nfind the babies with Isabel in the back drawing-room. They were having\nrides on the leopard skin thrown over the sofa back, or they were\nplaying shops with Isabel's desk for a counter, or Pad was sitting on\nthe hearthrug rowing away for dear life with a little brass fire shovel,\nwhile Johnny shot at pirates with the tongs. Every evening they each had\na pick-a-back up the narrow stairs to their fat old Nanny.\n\nYes, he supposed it was a poky little house. A little white house with\nblue curtains and a window-box of petunias. William met their friends at\nthe door with \"Seen our petunias? Pretty terrific for London, don't you\nthink?\"\n\nBut the imbecile thing, the absolutely extraordinary thing was that he\nhadn't the slightest idea that Isabel wasn't as happy as he. God, what\nblindness! He hadn't the remotest notion in those days that she really\nhated that inconvenient little house, that she thought the fat Nanny\nwas ruining the babies, that she was desperately lonely, pining for new\npeople and new music and pictures and so on. If they hadn't gone to that\nstudio party at Moira Morrison's--if Moira Morrison hadn't said as they\nwere leaving, \"I'm going to rescue your wife, selfish man. She's like\nan exquisite little Titania\"--if Isabel hadn't gone with Moira to\nParis--if--if...\n\nThe train stopped at another station. Bettingford. Good heavens! They'd\nbe there in ten minutes. William stuffed that papers back into his\npockets; the young man opposite had long since disappeared. Now the\nother two got out. The late afternoon sun shone on women in cotton\nfrocks and little sunburnt, barefoot children. It blazed on a silky\nyellow flower with coarse leaves which sprawled over a bank of rock. The\nair ruffling through the window smelled of the sea. Had Isabel the same\ncrowd with her this week-end, wondered William?\n\nAnd he remembered the holidays they used to have, the four of them, with\na little farm girl, Rose, to look after the babies. Isabel wore a jersey\nand her hair in a plait; she looked about fourteen. Lord! how his nose\nused to peel! And the amount they ate, and the amount they slept in that\nimmense feather bed with their feet locked together... William couldn't\nhelp a grim smile as he thought of Isabel's horror if she knew the full\nextent of his sentimentality.\n\n*****\n\n\"Hillo, William!\" She was at the station after all, standing just as he\nhad imagined, apart from the others, and--William's heart leapt--she was\nalone.\n\n\"Hallo, Isabel!\" William stared. He thought she looked so beautiful that\nhe had to say something, \"You look very cool.\"\n\n\"Do I?\" said Isabel. \"I don't feel very cool. Come along, your horrid\nold train is late. The taxi's outside.\" She put her hand lightly on his\narm as they passed the ticket collector. \"We've all come to meet you,\"\nshe said. \"But we've left Bobby Kane at the sweet shop, to be called\nfor.\"\n\n\"Oh!\" said William. It was all he could say for the moment.\n\nThere in the glare waited the taxi, with Bill Hunt and Dennis Green\nsprawling on one side, their hats tilted over their faces, while on the\nother, Moira Morrison, in a bonnet like a huge strawberry, jumped up and\ndown.\n\n\"No ice! No ice! No ice!\" she shouted gaily.\n\nAnd Dennis chimed in from under his hat. \"Only to be had from the\nfishmonger's.\"\n\nAnd Bill Hunt, emerging, added, \"With whole fish in it.\"\n\n\"Oh, what a bore!\" wailed Isabel. And she explained to William how\nthey had been chasing round the town for ice while she waited for\nhim. \"Simply everything is running down the steep cliffs into the sea,\nbeginning with the butter.\"\n\n\"We shall have to anoint ourselves with butter,\" said Dennis. \"May thy\nhead, William, lack not ointment.\"\n\n\"Look here,\" said William, \"how are we going to sit? I'd better get up\nby the driver.\"\n\n\"No, Bobby Kane's by the driver,\" said Isabel. \"You're to sit between\nMoira and me.\" The taxi started. \"What have you got in those mysterious\nparcels?\"\n\n\"De-cap-it-ated heads!\" said Bill Hunt, shuddering beneath his hat.\n\n\"Oh, fruit!\" Isabel sounded very pleased. \"Wise William! A melon and a\npineapple. How too nice!\"\n\n\"No, wait a bit,\" said William, smiling. But he really was anxious. \"I\nbrought them down for the kiddies.\"\n\n\"Oh, my dear!\" Isabel laughed, and slipped her hand through his arm.\n\"They'd be rolling in agonies if they were to eat them. No\"--she patted\nhis hand--\"you must bring them something next time. I refuse to part\nwith my pineapple.\"\n\n\"Cruel Isabel! Do let me smell it!\" said Moira. She flung her arms\nacross William appealingly. \"Oh!\" The strawberry bonnet fell forward:\nshe sounded quite faint.\n\n\"A Lady in Love with a Pineapple,\" said Dennis, as the taxi drew up\nbefore a little shop with a striped blind. Out came Bobby Kane, his arms\nfull of little packets.\n\n\"I do hope they'll be good. I've chosen them because of the colours.\nThere are some round things which really look too divine. And just look\nat this nougat,\" he cried ecstatically, \"just look at it! It's a perfect\nlittle ballet.\"\n\nBut at that moment the shopman appeared. \"Oh, I forgot. They're none of\nthem paid for,\" said Bobby, looking frightened. Isabel gave the shopman\na note, and Bobby was radiant again. \"Hallo, William! I'm sitting by the\ndriver.\" And bareheaded, all in white, with his sleeves rolled up to the\nshoulders, he leapt into his place. \"Avanti!\" he cried...\n\nAfter tea the others went off to bathe, while William stayed and made\nhis peace with the kiddies. But Johnny and Paddy were asleep, the\nrose-red glow had paled, bats were flying, and still the bathers had\nnot returned. As William wandered downstairs, the maid crossed the hall\ncarrying a lamp. He followed her into the sitting-room. It was a long\nroom, coloured yellow. On the wall opposite William some one had painted\na young man, over life-size, with very wobbly legs, offering a wide-eyed\ndaisy to a young woman who had one very short arm and one very long,\nthin one. Over the chairs and sofa there hung strips of black material,\ncovered with big splashes like broken eggs, and everywhere one looked\nthere seemed to be an ash-tray full of cigarette ends. William sat down\nin one of the arm-chairs. Nowadays, when one felt with one hand down the\nsides, it wasn't to come upon a sheep with three legs or a cow that had\nlost one horn, or a very fat dove out of the Noah's Ark. One fished\nup yet another little paper-covered book of smudged-looking poems... He\nthought of the wad of papers in his pocket, but he was too hungry and\ntired to read. The door was open; sounds came from the kitchen. The\nservants were talking as if they were alone in the house. Suddenly\nthere came a loud screech of laughter and an equally loud \"Sh!\" They had\nremembered him. William got up and went through the French windows into\nthe garden, and as he stood there in the shadow he heard the bathers\ncoming up the sandy road; their voices rang through the quiet.\n\n\"I think its up to Moira to use her little arts and wiles.\"\n\nA tragic moan from Moira.\n\n\"We ought to have a gramophone for the weekends that played 'The Maid of\nthe Mountains.'\"\n\n\"Oh no! Oh no!\" cried Isabel's voice. \"That's not fair to William. Be\nnice to him, my children! He's only staying until to-morrow evening.\"\n\n\"Leave him to me,\" cried Bobby Kane. \"I'm awfully good at looking after\npeople.\"\n\nThe gate swung open and shut. William moved on the terrace; they had\nseen him. \"Hallo, William!\" And Bobby Kane, flapping his towel, began to\nleap and pirouette on the parched lawn. \"Pity you didn't come, William.\nThe water was divine. And we all went to a little pub afterwards and had\nsloe gin.\"\n\nThe others had reached the house. \"I say, Isabel,\" called Bobby, \"would\nyou like me to wear my Nijinsky dress to-night?\"\n\n\"No,\" said Isabel, \"nobody's going to dress. We're all starving.\nWilliam's starving, too. Come along, mes amis, let's begin with\nsardines.\"\n\n\"I've found the sardines,\" said Moira, and she ran into the hall,\nholding a box high in the air.\n\n\"A Lady with a Box of Sardines,\" said Dennis gravely.\n\n\"Well, William, and how's London?\" asked Bill Hunt, drawing the cork out\nof a bottle of whisky.\n\n\"Oh, London's not much changed,\" answered William.\n\n\"Good old London,\" said Bobby, very hearty, spearing a sardine.\n\nBut a moment later William was forgotten. Moira Morrison began wondering\nwhat colour one's legs really were under water.\n\n\"Mine are the palest, palest mushroom colour.\"\n\nBill and Dennis ate enormously. And Isabel filled glasses, and changed\nplates, and found matches, smiling blissfully. At one moment, she said,\n\"I do wish, Bill, you'd paint it.\"\n\n\"Paint what?\" said Bill loudly, stuffing his mouth with bread.\n\n\"Us,\" said Isabel, \"round the table. It would be so fascinating in\ntwenty years' time.\"\n\nBill screwed up his eyes and chewed. \"Light's wrong,\" he said rudely,\n\"far too much yellow\"; and went on eating. And that seemed to charm\nIsabel, too.\n\nBut after supper they were all so tired they could do nothing but yawn\nuntil it was late enough to go to bed...\n\nIt was not until William was waiting for his taxi the next afternoon\nthat he found himself alone with Isabel. When he brought his suit-case\ndown into the hall, Isabel left the others and went over to him. She\nstooped down and picked up the suit-case. \"What a weight!\" she said, and\nshe gave a little awkward laugh. \"Let me carry it! To the gate.\"\n\n\"No, why should you?\" said William. \"Of course, not. Give it to me.\"\n\n\"Oh, please, do let me,\" said Isabel. \"I want to, really.\" They walked\ntogether silently. William felt there was nothing to say now.\n\n\"There,\" said Isabel triumphantly, setting the suit-case down, and she\nlooked anxiously along the sandy road. \"I hardly seem to have seen you\nthis time,\" she said breathlessly. \"It's so short, isn't it? I feel\nyou've only just come. Next time--\" The taxi came into sight. \"I hope\nthey look after you properly in London. I'm so sorry the babies have\nbeen out all day, but Miss Neil had arranged it. They'll hate missing\nyou. Poor William, going back to London.\" The taxi turned. \"Good-bye!\"\nShe gave him a little hurried kiss; she was gone.\n\nFields, trees, hedges streamed by. They shook through the empty,\nblind-looking little town, ground up the steep pull to the station.\n\nThe train was in. William made straight for a first-class smoker, flung\nback into the corner, but this time he let the papers alone. He folded\nhis arms against the dull, persistent gnawing, and began in his mind to\nwrite a letter to Isabel.\n\n*****\n\nThe post was late as usual. They sat outside the house in long chairs\nunder coloured parasols. Only Bobby Kane lay on the turf at Isabel's\nfeet. It was dull, stifling; the day drooped like a flag.\n\n\"Do you think there will be Mondays in Heaven?\" asked Bobby childishly.\n\nAnd Dennis murmured, \"Heaven will be one long Monday.\"\n\nBut Isabel couldn't help wondering what had happened to the salmon they\nhad for supper last night. She had meant to have fish mayonnaise for\nlunch and now...\n\nMoira was asleep. Sleeping was her latest discovery. \"It's so wonderful.\nOne simply shuts one's eyes, that's all. It's so delicious.\"\n\nWhen the old ruddy postman came beating along the sandy road on his\ntricycle one felt the handle-bars ought to have been oars.\n\nBill Hunt put down his book. \"Letters,\" he said complacently, and they\nall waited. But, heartless postman--O malignant world! There was only\none, a fat one for Isabel. Not even a paper.\n\n\"And mine's only from William,\" said Isabel mournfully.\n\n\"From William--already?\"\n\n\"He's sending you back your marriage lines as a gentle reminder.\"\n\n\"Does everybody have marriage lines? I thought they were only for\nservants.\"\n\n\"Pages and pages! Look at her! A Lady reading a Letter,\" said Dennis.\n\n\"My darling, precious Isabel.\" Pages and pages there were. As Isabel\nread on her feeling of astonishment changed to a stifled feeling. What\non earth had induced William... ? How extraordinary it was... What\ncould have made him... ? She felt confused, more and more excited, even\nfrightened. It was just like William. Was it? It was absurd, of course,\nit must be absurd, ridiculous. \"Ha, ha, ha! Oh dear!\" What was she to\ndo? Isabel flung back in her chair and laughed till she couldn't stop\nlaughing.\n\n\"Do, do tell us,\" said the others. \"You must tell us.\"\n\n\"I'm longing to,\" gurgled Isabel. She sat up, gathered the letter,\nand waved it at them. \"Gather round,\" she said. \"Listen, it's too\nmarvellous. A love-letter!\"\n\n\"A love-letter! But how divine!\" \"Darling, precious Isabel.\" But she had\nhardly begun before their laughter interrupted her.\n\n\"Go on, Isabel, it's perfect.\"\n\n\"It's the most marvellous find.\"\n\n\"Oh, do go on, Isabel!\"\n\n\"God forbid, my darling, that I should be a drag on your happiness.\"\n\n\"Oh! oh! oh!\"\n\n\"Sh! sh! sh!\"\n\nAnd Isabel went on. When she reached the end they were hysterical: Bobby\nrolled on the turf and almost sobbed.\n\n\"You must let me have it just as it is, entire, for my new book,\" said\nDennis firmly. \"I shall give it a whole chapter.\"\n\n\"Oh, Isabel,\" moaned Moira, \"that wonderful bit about holding you in his\narms!\"\n\n\"I always thought those letters in divorce cases were made up. But they\npale before this.\"\n\n\"Let me hold it. Let me read it, mine own self,\" said Bobby Kane.\n\nBut, to their surprise, Isabel crushed the letter in her hand. She\nwas laughing no longer. She glanced quickly at them all; she looked\nexhausted. \"No, not just now. Not just now,\" she stammered.\n\nAnd before they could recover she had run into the house, through the\nhall, up the stairs into her bedroom. Down she sat on the side of\nthe bed. \"How vile, odious, abominable, vulgar,\" muttered Isabel. She\npressed her eyes with her knuckles and rocked to and fro. And again she\nsaw them, but not four, more like forty, laughing, sneering, jeering,\nstretching out their hands while she read them William's letter. Oh,\nwhat a loathsome thing to have done. How could she have done it! \"God\nforbid, my darling, that I should be a drag on your happiness.\" William!\nIsabel pressed her face into the pillow. But she felt that even the\ngrave bedroom knew her for what she was, shallow, tinkling, vain...\n\nPresently from the garden below there came voices.\n\n\"Isabel, we're all going for a bathe. Do come!\"\n\n\"Come, thou wife of William!\"\n\n\"Call her once before you go, call once yet!\"\n\nIsabel sat up. Now was the moment, now she must decide. Would she go\nwith them, or stay here and write to William. Which, which should it be?\n\"I must make up my mind.\" Oh, but how could there be any question? Of\ncourse she would stay here and write.\n\n\"Titania!\" piped Moira.\n\n\"Isa-bel?\"\n\nNo, it was too difficult. \"I'll--I'll go with them, and write to William\nlater. Some other time. Later. Not now. But I shall certainly write,\"\nthought Isabel hurriedly.\n\nAnd, laughing, in the new way, she ran down the stairs.\n\n\n\n\n</CHAPTER>\n"}, {"id": 8, "text": "<CHAPTER>\n8. THE VOYAGE.\n\nThe Picton boat was due to leave at half-past eleven. It was a beautiful\nnight, mild, starry, only when they got out of the cab and started to\nwalk down the Old Wharf that jutted out into the harbour, a faint wind\nblowing off the water ruffled under Fenella's hat, and she put up her\nhand to keep it on. It was dark on the Old Wharf, very dark; the wool\nsheds, the cattle trucks, the cranes standing up so high, the little\nsquat railway engine, all seemed carved out of solid darkness. Here and\nthere on a rounded wood-pile, that was like the stalk of a huge black\nmushroom, there hung a lantern, but it seemed afraid to unfurl its\ntimid, quivering light in all that blackness; it burned softly, as if\nfor itself.\n\nFenella's father pushed on with quick, nervous strides. Beside him her\ngrandma bustled along in her crackling black ulster; they went so fast\nthat she had now and again to give an undignified little skip to keep up\nwith them. As well as her luggage strapped into a neat sausage, Fenella\ncarried clasped to her her grandma's umbrella, and the handle, which was\na swan's head, kept giving her shoulder a sharp little peck as if it too\nwanted her to hurry... Men, their caps pulled down, their collars turned\nup, swung by; a few women all muffled scurried along; and one tiny boy,\nonly his little black arms and legs showing out of a white woolly shawl,\nwas jerked along angrily between his father and mother; he looked like a\nbaby fly that had fallen into the cream.\n\nThen suddenly, so suddenly that Fenella and her grandma both leapt,\nthere sounded from behind the largest wool shed, that had a trail of\nsmoke hanging over it, \"Mia-oo-oo-O-O!\"\n\n\"First whistle,\" said her father briefly, and at that moment they came\nin sight of the Picton boat. Lying beside the dark wharf, all strung,\nall beaded with round golden lights, the Picton boat looked as if she\nwas more ready to sail among stars than out into the cold sea. People\npressed along the gangway. First went her grandma, then her father, then\nFenella. There was a high step down on to the deck, and an old sailor in\na jersey standing by gave her his dry, hard hand. They were there; they\nstepped out of the way of the hurrying people, and standing under\na little iron stairway that led to the upper deck they began to say\ngood-bye.\n\n\"There, mother, there's your luggage!\" said Fenella's father, giving\ngrandma another strapped-up sausage.\n\n\"Thank you, Frank.\"\n\n\"And you've got your cabin tickets safe?\"\n\n\"Yes, dear.\"\n\n\"And your other tickets?\"\n\nGrandma felt for them inside her glove and showed him the tips.\n\n\"That's right.\"\n\nHe sounded stern, but Fenella, eagerly watching him, saw that he looked\ntired and sad. \"Mia-oo-oo-O-O!\" The second whistle blared just above\ntheir heads, and a voice like a cry shouted, \"Any more for the gangway?\"\n\n\"You'll give my love to father,\" Fenella saw her father's lips say. And\nher grandma, very agitated, answered, \"Of course I will, dear. Go now.\nYou'll be left. Go now, Frank. Go now.\"\n\n\"It's all right, mother. I've got another three minutes.\" To her\nsurprise Fenella saw her father take off his hat. He clasped grandma in\nhis arms and pressed her to him. \"God bless you, mother!\" she heard him\nsay.\n\nAnd grandma put her hand, with the black thread glove that was worn\nthrough on her ring finger, against his cheek, and she sobbed, \"God\nbless you, my own brave son!\"\n\nThis was so awful that Fenella quickly turned her back on them,\nswallowed once, twice, and frowned terribly at a little green star on a\nmast head. But she had to turn round again; her father was going.\n\n\"Good-bye, Fenella. Be a good girl.\" His cold, wet moustache brushed her\ncheek. But Fenella caught hold of the lapels of his coat.\n\n\"How long am I going to stay?\" she whispered anxiously. He wouldn't look\nat her. He shook her off gently, and gently said, \"We'll see about that.\nHere! Where's your hand?\" He pressed something into her palm. \"Here's a\nshilling in case you should need it.\"\n\nA shilling! She must be going away for ever! \"Father!\" cried Fenella.\nBut he was gone. He was the last off the ship. The sailors put their\nshoulders to the gangway. A huge coil of dark rope went flying through\nthe air and fell \"thump\" on the wharf. A bell rang; a whistle shrilled.\nSilently the dark wharf began to slip, to slide, to edge away from them.\nNow there was a rush of water between. Fenella strained to see with all\nher might. \"Was that father turning round?\"--or waving?--or standing\nalone?--or walking off by himself? The strip of water grew broader,\ndarker. Now the Picton boat began to swing round steady, pointing out to\nsea. It was no good looking any longer. There was nothing to be seen but\na few lights, the face of the town clock hanging in the air, and more\nlights, little patches of them, on the dark hills.\n\nThe freshening wind tugged at Fenella's skirts; she went back to her\ngrandma. To her relief grandma seemed no longer sad. She had put the\ntwo sausages of luggage one on top of the other, and she was sitting\non them, her hands folded, her head a little on one side. There was an\nintent, bright look on her face. Then Fenella saw that her lips were\nmoving and guessed that she was praying. But the old woman gave her a\nbright nod as if to say the prayer was nearly over. She unclasped\nher hands, sighed, clasped them again, bent forward, and at last gave\nherself a soft shake.\n\n\"And now, child,\" she said, fingering the bow of her bonnet-strings, \"I\nthink we ought to see about our cabins. Keep close to me, and mind you\ndon't slip.\"\n\n\"Yes, grandma!\"\n\n\"And be careful the umbrellas aren't caught in the stair rail. I saw a\nbeautiful umbrella broken in half like that on my way over.\"\n\n\"Yes, grandma.\"\n\nDark figures of men lounged against the rails. In the glow of\ntheir pipes a nose shone out, or the peak of a cap, or a pair of\nsurprised-looking eyebrows. Fenella glanced up. High in the air, a\nlittle figure, his hands thrust in his short jacket pockets, stood\nstaring out to sea. The ship rocked ever so little, and she thought the\nstars rocked too. And now a pale steward in a linen coat, holding a\ntray high in the palm of his hand, stepped out of a lighted doorway and\nskimmed past them. They went through that doorway. Carefully over the\nhigh brass-bound step on to the rubber mat and then down such a terribly\nsteep flight of stairs that grandma had to put both feet on each step,\nand Fenella clutched the clammy brass rail and forgot all about the\nswan-necked umbrella.\n\nAt the bottom grandma stopped; Fenella was rather afraid she was going\nto pray again. But no, it was only to get out the cabin tickets. They\nwere in the saloon. It was glaring bright and stifling; the air smelled\nof paint and burnt chop-bones and indiarubber. Fenella wished her\ngrandma would go on, but the old woman was not to be hurried. An immense\nbasket of ham sandwiches caught her eye. She went up to them and touched\nthe top one delicately with her finger.\n\n\"How much are the sandwiches?\" she asked.\n\n\"Tuppence!\" bawled a rude steward, slamming down a knife and fork.\n\nGrandma could hardly believe it.\n\n\"Twopence each?\" she asked.\n\n\"That's right,\" said the steward, and he winked at his companion.\n\nGrandma made a small, astonished face. Then she whispered primly to\nFenella. \"What wickedness!\" And they sailed out at the further door\nand along a passage that had cabins on either side. Such a very nice\nstewardess came to meet them. She was dressed all in blue, and her\ncollar and cuffs were fastened with large brass buttons. She seemed to\nknow grandma well.\n\n\"Well, Mrs. Crane,\" said she, unlocking their washstand. \"We've got you\nback again. It's not often you give yourself a cabin.\"\n\n\"No,\" said grandma. \"But this time my dear son's thoughtfulness--\"\n\n\"I hope--\" began the stewardess. Then she turned round and took a long,\nmournful look at grandma's blackness and at Fenella's black coat and\nskirt, black blouse, and hat with a crape rose.\n\nGrandma nodded. \"It was God's will,\" said she.\n\nThe stewardess shut her lips and, taking a deep breath, she seemed to\nexpand.\n\n\"What I always say is,\" she said, as though it was her own discovery,\n\"sooner or later each of us has to go, and that's a certingty.\" She\npaused. \"Now, can I bring you anything, Mrs Crane? A cup of tea? I know\nit's no good offering you a little something to keep the cold out.\"\n\nGrandma shook her head. \"Nothing, thank you. We've got a few wine\nbiscuits, and Fenella has a very nice banana.\"\n\n\"Then I'll give you a look later on,\" said the stewardess, and she went\nout, shutting the door.\n\nWhat a very small cabin it was! It was like being shut up in a box with\ngrandma. The dark round eye above the washstand gleamed at them dully.\nFenella felt shy. She stood against the door, still clasping her luggage\nand the umbrella. Were they going to get undressed in here? Already her\ngrandma had taken off her bonnet, and, rolling up the strings, she fixed\neach with a pin to the lining before she hung the bonnet up. Her white\nhair shone like silk; the little bun at the back was covered with a\nblack net. Fenella hardly ever saw her grandma with her head uncovered;\nshe looked strange.\n\n\"I shall put on the woollen fascinator your dear mother crocheted for\nme,\" said grandma, and, unstrapping the sausage, she took it out and\nwound it round her head; the fringe of grey bobbles danced at her\neyebrows as she smiled tenderly and mournfully at Fenella. Then\nshe undid her bodice, and something under that, and something else\nunderneath that. Then there seemed a short, sharp tussle, and grandma\nflushed faintly. Snip! Snap! She had undone her stays. She breathed a\nsigh of relief, and sitting on the plush couch, she slowly and carefully\npulled off her elastic-sided boots and stood them side by side.\n\nBy the time Fenella had taken off her coat and skirt and put on her\nflannel dressing-gown grandma was quite ready.\n\n\"Must I take off my boots, grandma? They're lace.\"\n\nGrandma gave them a moment's deep consideration. \"You'd feel a great\ndeal more comfortable if you did, child,\" said she. She kissed Fenella.\n\"Don't forget to say your prayers. Our dear Lord is with us when we\nare at sea even more than when we are on dry land. And because I am an\nexperienced traveller,\" said grandma briskly, \"I shall take the upper\nberth.\"\n\n\"But, grandma, however will you get up there?\"\n\nThree little spider-like steps were all Fenella saw. The old woman gave\na small silent laugh before she mounted them nimbly, and she peered over\nthe high bunk at the astonished Fenella.\n\n\"You didn't think your grandma could do that, did you?\" said she. And as\nshe sank back Fenella heard her light laugh again.\n\nThe hard square of brown soap would not lather, and the water in the\nbottle was like a kind of blue jelly. How hard it was, too, to turn down\nthose stiff sheets; you simply had to tear your way in. If everything\nhad been different, Fenella might have got the giggles... At last she\nwas inside, and while she lay there panting, there sounded from above\na long, soft whispering, as though some one was gently, gently rustling\namong tissue paper to find something. It was grandma saying her\nprayers...\n\nA long time passed. Then the stewardess came in; she trod softly and\nleaned her hand on grandma's bunk.\n\n\"We're just entering the Straits,\" she said.\n\n\"Oh!\"\n\n\"It's a fine night, but we're rather empty. We may pitch a little.\"\n\nAnd indeed at that moment the Picton Boat rose and rose and hung in the\nair just long enough to give a shiver before she swung down again, and\nthere was the sound of heavy water slapping against her sides. Fenella\nremembered she had left the swan-necked umbrella standing up on the\nlittle couch. If it fell over, would it break? But grandma remembered\ntoo, at the same time.\n\n\"I wonder if you'd mind, stewardess, laying down my umbrella,\" she\nwhispered.\n\n\"Not at all, Mrs. Crane.\" And the stewardess, coming back to grandma,\nbreathed, \"Your little granddaughter's in such a beautiful sleep.\"\n\n\"God be praised for that!\" said grandma.\n\n\"Poor little motherless mite!\" said the stewardess. And grandma was\nstill telling the stewardess all about what happened when Fenella fell\nasleep.\n\nBut she hadn't been asleep long enough to dream before she woke up again\nto see something waving in the air above her head. What was it? What\ncould it be? It was a small grey foot. Now another joined it. They\nseemed to be feeling about for something; there came a sigh.\n\n\"I'm awake, grandma,\" said Fenella.\n\n\"Oh, dear, am I near the ladder?\" asked grandma. \"I thought it was this\nend.\"\n\n\"No, grandma, it's the other. I'll put your foot on it. Are we there?\"\nasked Fenella.\n\n\"In the harbour,\" said grandma. \"We must get up, child. You'd better\nhave a biscuit to steady yourself before you move.\"\n\nBut Fenella had hopped out of her bunk. The lamp was still burning,\nbut night was over, and it was cold. Peering through that round eye she\ncould see far off some rocks. Now they were scattered over with foam;\nnow a gull flipped by; and now there came a long piece of real land.\n\n\"It's land, grandma,\" said Fenella, wonderingly, as though they had been\nat sea for weeks together. She hugged herself; she stood on one leg and\nrubbed it with the toes of the other foot; she was trembling. Oh, it had\nall been so sad lately. Was it going to change? But all her grandma\nsaid was, \"Make haste, child. I should leave your nice banana for\nthe stewardess as you haven't eaten it.\" And Fenella put on her black\nclothes again and a button sprang off one of her gloves and rolled to\nwhere she couldn't reach it. They went up on deck.\n\nBut if it had been cold in the cabin, on deck it was like ice. The sun\nwas not up yet, but the stars were dim, and the cold pale sky was the\nsame colour as the cold pale sea. On the land a white mist rose and\nfell. Now they could see quite plainly dark bush. Even the shapes of the\numbrella ferns showed, and those strange silvery withered trees that are\nlike skeletons... Now they could see the landing-stage and some little\nhouses, pale too, clustered together, like shells on the lid of a box.\nThe other passengers tramped up and down, but more slowly than they had\nthe night before, and they looked gloomy.\n\nAnd now the landing-stage came out to meet them. Slowly it swam towards\nthe Picton boat, and a man holding a coil of rope, and a cart with a\nsmall drooping horse and another man sitting on the step, came too.\n\n\"It's Mr. Penreddy, Fenella, come for us,\" said grandma. She sounded\npleased. Her white waxen cheeks were blue with cold, her chin trembled,\nand she had to keep wiping her eyes and her little pink nose.\n\n\"You've got my--\"\n\n\"Yes, grandma.\" Fenella showed it to her.\n\nThe rope came flying through the air, and \"smack\" it fell on to the\ndeck. The gangway was lowered. Again Fenella followed her grandma on to\nthe wharf over to the little cart, and a moment later they were bowling\naway. The hooves of the little horse drummed over the wooden piles, then\nsank softly into the sandy road. Not a soul was to be seen; there was\nnot even a feather of smoke. The mist rose and fell and the sea still\nsounded asleep as slowly it turned on the beach.\n\n\"I seen Mr. Crane yestiddy,\" said Mr. Penreddy. \"He looked himself then.\nMissus knocked him up a batch of scones last week.\"\n\nAnd now the little horse pulled up before one of the shell-like houses.\nThey got down. Fenella put her hand on the gate, and the big, trembling\ndew-drops soaked through her glove-tips. Up a little path of round\nwhite pebbles they went, with drenched sleeping flowers on either side.\nGrandma's delicate white picotees were so heavy with dew that they were\nfallen, but their sweet smell was part of the cold morning. The blinds\nwere down in the little house; they mounted the steps on to the veranda.\nA pair of old bluchers was on one side of the door, and a large red\nwatering-can on the other.\n\n\"Tut! tut! Your grandpa,\" said grandma. She turned the handle. Not a\nsound. She called, \"Walter!\" And immediately a deep voice that sounded\nhalf stifled called back, \"Is that you, Mary?\"\n\n\"Wait, dear,\" said grandma. \"Go in there.\" She pushed Fenella gently\ninto a small dusky sitting-room.\n\nOn the table a white cat, that had been folded up like a camel, rose,\nstretched itself, yawned, and then sprang on to the tips of its toes.\nFenella buried one cold little hand in the white, warm fur, and smiled\ntimidly while she stroked and listened to grandma's gentle voice and the\nrolling tones of grandpa.\n\nA door creaked. \"Come in, dear.\" The old woman beckoned, Fenella\nfollowed. There, lying to one side on an immense bed, lay grandpa.\nJust his head with a white tuft and his rosy face and long silver beard\nshowed over the quilt. He was like a very old wide-awake bird.\n\n\"Well, my girl!\" said grandpa. \"Give us a kiss!\" Fenella kissed him.\n\"Ugh!\" said grandpa. \"Her little nose is as cold as a button. What's\nthat she's holding? Her grandma's umbrella?\"\n\nFenella smiled again, and crooked the swan neck over the bed-rail. Above\nthe bed there was a big text in a deep black frame:--\n\n     \"Lost!  One Golden Hour\n      Set with Sixty Diamond Minutes.\n      No Reward Is Offered\n      For It Is Gone For Ever!\"\n\n\"Yer grandma painted that,\" said grandpa. And he ruffled his white tuft\nand looked at Fenella so merrily she almost thought he winked at her.\n\n\n\n\n</CHAPTER>\n"}, {"id": 9, "text": "<CHAPTER>\n9. MISS BRILL.\n\nAlthough it was so brilliantly fine--the blue sky powdered with gold\nand great spots of light like white wine splashed over the Jardins\nPubliques--Miss Brill was glad that she had decided on her fur. The air\nwas motionless, but when you opened your mouth there was just a faint\nchill, like a chill from a glass of iced water before you sip, and now\nand again a leaf came drifting--from nowhere, from the sky. Miss Brill\nput up her hand and touched her fur. Dear little thing! It was nice to\nfeel it again. She had taken it out of its box that afternoon, shaken\nout the moth-powder, given it a good brush, and rubbed the life back\ninto the dim little eyes. \"What has been happening to me?\" said the sad\nlittle eyes. Oh, how sweet it was to see them snap at her again from\nthe red eiderdown!... But the nose, which was of some black composition,\nwasn't at all firm. It must have had a knock, somehow. Never mind--a\nlittle dab of black sealing-wax when the time came--when it was\nabsolutely necessary... Little rogue! Yes, she really felt like that\nabout it. Little rogue biting its tail just by her left ear. She could\nhave taken it off and laid it on her lap and stroked it. She felt\na tingling in her hands and arms, but that came from walking, she\nsupposed. And when she breathed, something light and sad--no, not sad,\nexactly--something gentle seemed to move in her bosom.\n\nThere were a number of people out this afternoon, far more than last\nSunday. And the band sounded louder and gayer. That was because the\nSeason had begun. For although the band played all the year round on\nSundays, out of season it was never the same. It was like some one\nplaying with only the family to listen; it didn't care how it played if\nthere weren't any strangers present. Wasn't the conductor wearing a new\ncoat, too? She was sure it was new. He scraped with his foot and flapped\nhis arms like a rooster about to crow, and the bandsmen sitting in the\ngreen rotunda blew out their cheeks and glared at the music. Now there\ncame a little \"flutey\" bit--very pretty!--a little chain of bright\ndrops. She was sure it would be repeated. It was; she lifted her head\nand smiled.\n\nOnly two people shared her \"special\" seat: a fine old man in a velvet\ncoat, his hands clasped over a huge carved walking-stick, and a big\nold woman, sitting upright, with a roll of knitting on her embroidered\napron. They did not speak. This was disappointing, for Miss Brill always\nlooked forward to the conversation. She had become really quite expert,\nshe thought, at listening as though she didn't listen, at sitting in\nother people's lives just for a minute while they talked round her.\n\nShe glanced, sideways, at the old couple. Perhaps they would go soon.\nLast Sunday, too, hadn't been as interesting as usual. An Englishman\nand his wife, he wearing a dreadful Panama hat and she button boots. And\nshe'd gone on the whole time about how she ought to wear spectacles;\nshe knew she needed them; but that it was no good getting any; they'd be\nsure to break and they'd never keep on. And he'd been so patient. He'd\nsuggested everything--gold rims, the kind that curved round your ears,\nlittle pads inside the bridge. No, nothing would please her. \"They'll\nalways be sliding down my nose!\" Miss Brill had wanted to shake her.\n\nThe old people sat on the bench, still as statues. Never mind, there was\nalways the crowd to watch. To and fro, in front of the flower-beds and\nthe band rotunda, the couples and groups paraded, stopped to talk, to\ngreet, to buy a handful of flowers from the old beggar who had his tray\nfixed to the railings. Little children ran among them, swooping and\nlaughing; little boys with big white silk bows under their chins, little\ngirls, little French dolls, dressed up in velvet and lace. And sometimes\na tiny staggerer came suddenly rocking into the open from under the\ntrees, stopped, stared, as suddenly sat down \"flop,\" until its small\nhigh-stepping mother, like a young hen, rushed scolding to its rescue.\nOther people sat on the benches and green chairs, but they were\nnearly always the same, Sunday after Sunday, and--Miss Brill had often\nnoticed--there was something funny about nearly all of them. They were\nodd, silent, nearly all old, and from the way they stared they looked as\nthough they'd just come from dark little rooms or even--even cupboards!\n\nBehind the rotunda the slender trees with yellow leaves down drooping,\nand through them just a line of sea, and beyond the blue sky with\ngold-veined clouds.\n\nTum-tum-tum tiddle-um! tiddle-um! tum tiddley-um tum ta! blew the band.\n\nTwo young girls in red came by and two young soldiers in blue met them,\nand they laughed and paired and went off arm-in-arm. Two peasant women\nwith funny straw hats passed, gravely, leading beautiful smoke-coloured\ndonkeys. A cold, pale nun hurried by. A beautiful woman came along and\ndropped her bunch of violets, and a little boy ran after to hand them to\nher, and she took them and threw them away as if they'd been poisoned.\nDear me! Miss Brill didn't know whether to admire that or not! And now\nan ermine toque and a gentleman in grey met just in front of her. He\nwas tall, stiff, dignified, and she was wearing the ermine toque she'd\nbought when her hair was yellow. Now everything, her hair, her face,\neven her eyes, was the same colour as the shabby ermine, and her hand,\nin its cleaned glove, lifted to dab her lips, was a tiny yellowish paw.\nOh, she was so pleased to see him--delighted! She rather thought\nthey were going to meet that afternoon. She described where she'd\nbeen--everywhere, here, there, along by the sea. The day was so\ncharming--didn't he agree? And wouldn't he, perhaps?... But he shook his\nhead, lighted a cigarette, slowly breathed a great deep puff into her\nface, and even while she was still talking and laughing, flicked the\nmatch away and walked on. The ermine toque was alone; she smiled more\nbrightly than ever. But even the band seemed to know what she was\nfeeling and played more softly, played tenderly, and the drum beat, \"The\nBrute! The Brute!\" over and over. What would she do? What was going to\nhappen now? But as Miss Brill wondered, the ermine toque turned, raised\nher hand as though she'd seen some one else, much nicer, just over\nthere, and pattered away. And the band changed again and played more\nquickly, more gayly than ever, and the old couple on Miss Brill's seat\ngot up and marched away, and such a funny old man with long whiskers\nhobbled along in time to the music and was nearly knocked over by four\ngirls walking abreast.\n\nOh, how fascinating it was! How she enjoyed it! How she loved sitting\nhere, watching it all! It was like a play. It was exactly like a play.\nWho could believe the sky at the back wasn't painted? But it wasn't till\na little brown dog trotted on solemn and then slowly trotted off, like\na little \"theatre\" dog, a little dog that had been drugged, that Miss\nBrill discovered what it was that made it so exciting. They were all\non the stage. They weren't only the audience, not only looking on;\nthey were acting. Even she had a part and came every Sunday. No doubt\nsomebody would have noticed if she hadn't been there; she was part of\nthe performance after all. How strange she'd never thought of it like\nthat before! And yet it explained why she made such a point of starting\nfrom home at just the same time each week--so as not to be late for\nthe performance--and it also explained why she had quite a queer,\nshy feeling at telling her English pupils how she spent her Sunday\nafternoons. No wonder! Miss Brill nearly laughed out loud. She was on\nthe stage. She thought of the old invalid gentleman to whom she read the\nnewspaper four afternoons a week while he slept in the garden. She had\ngot quite used to the frail head on the cotton pillow, the hollowed\neyes, the open mouth and the high pinched nose. If he'd been dead she\nmightn't have noticed for weeks; she wouldn't have minded. But suddenly\nhe knew he was having the paper read to him by an actress! \"An actress!\"\nThe old head lifted; two points of light quivered in the old eyes. \"An\nactress--are ye?\" And Miss Brill smoothed the newspaper as though it\nwere the manuscript of her part and said gently; \"Yes, I have been an\nactress for a long time.\"\n\nThe band had been having a rest. Now they started again. And what they\nplayed was warm, sunny, yet there was just a faint chill--a something,\nwhat was it?--not sadness--no, not sadness--a something that made you\nwant to sing. The tune lifted, lifted, the light shone; and it seemed\nto Miss Brill that in another moment all of them, all the whole company,\nwould begin singing. The young ones, the laughing ones who were moving\ntogether, they would begin, and the men's voices, very resolute and\nbrave, would join them. And then she too, she too, and the others on the\nbenches--they would come in with a kind of accompaniment--something low,\nthat scarcely rose or fell, something so beautiful--moving... And Miss\nBrill's eyes filled with tears and she looked smiling at all the\nother members of the company. Yes, we understand, we understand, she\nthought--though what they understood she didn't know.\n\nJust at that moment a boy and girl came and sat down where the old\ncouple had been. They were beautifully dressed; they were in love. The\nhero and heroine, of course, just arrived from his father's yacht. And\nstill soundlessly singing, still with that trembling smile, Miss Brill\nprepared to listen.\n\n\"No, not now,\" said the girl. \"Not here, I can't.\"\n\n\"But why? Because of that stupid old thing at the end there?\" asked the\nboy. \"Why does she come here at all--who wants her? Why doesn't she keep\nher silly old mug at home?\"\n\n\"It's her fu-ur which is so funny,\" giggled the girl. \"It's exactly like\na fried whiting.\"\n\n\"Ah, be off with you!\" said the boy in an angry whisper. Then: \"Tell me,\nma petite chere--\"\n\n\"No, not here,\" said the girl. \"Not yet.\"\n\n*****\n\nOn her way home she usually bought a slice of honey-cake at the baker's.\nIt was her Sunday treat. Sometimes there was an almond in her slice,\nsometimes not. It made a great difference. If there was an almond it was\nlike carrying home a tiny present--a surprise--something that might very\nwell not have been there. She hurried on the almond Sundays and struck\nthe match for the kettle in quite a dashing way.\n\nBut to-day she passed the baker's by, climbed the stairs, went into\nthe little dark room--her room like a cupboard--and sat down on the red\neiderdown. She sat there for a long time. The box that the fur came out\nof was on the bed. She unclasped the necklet quickly; quickly, without\nlooking, laid it inside. But when she put the lid on she thought she\nheard something crying.\n\n\n\n\n</CHAPTER>\n"}, {"id": 10, "text": "<CHAPTER>\n10. HER FIRST BALL.\n\nExactly when the ball began Leila would have found it hard to say.\nPerhaps her first real partner was the cab. It did not matter that she\nshared the cab with the Sheridan girls and their brother. She sat back\nin her own little corner of it, and the bolster on which her hand rested\nfelt like the sleeve of an unknown young man's dress suit; and away they\nbowled, past waltzing lamp-posts and houses and fences and trees.\n\n\"Have you really never been to a ball before, Leila? But, my child, how\ntoo weird--\" cried the Sheridan girls.\n\n\"Our nearest neighbour was fifteen miles,\" said Leila softly, gently\nopening and shutting her fan.\n\nOh dear, how hard it was to be indifferent like the others! She tried\nnot to smile too much; she tried not to care. But every single thing\nwas so new and exciting... Meg's tuberoses, Jose's long loop of amber,\nLaura's little dark head, pushing above her white fur like a flower\nthrough snow. She would remember for ever. It even gave her a pang to\nsee her cousin Laurie throw away the wisps of tissue paper he pulled\nfrom the fastenings of his new gloves. She would like to have kept those\nwisps as a keepsake, as a remembrance. Laurie leaned forward and put his\nhand on Laura's knee.\n\n\"Look here, darling,\" he said. \"The third and the ninth as usual. Twig?\"\n\nOh, how marvellous to have a brother! In her excitement Leila felt that\nif there had been time, if it hadn't been impossible, she couldn't have\nhelped crying because she was an only child, and no brother had ever\nsaid \"Twig?\" to her; no sister would ever say, as Meg said to Jose that\nmoment, \"I've never known your hair go up more successfully than it has\nto-night!\"\n\nBut, of course, there was no time. They were at the drill hall already;\nthere were cabs in front of them and cabs behind. The road was bright on\neither side with moving fan-like lights, and on the pavement gay couples\nseemed to float through the air; little satin shoes chased each other\nlike birds.\n\n\"Hold on to me, Leila; you'll get lost,\" said Laura.\n\n\"Come on, girls, let's make a dash for it,\" said Laurie.\n\nLeila put two fingers on Laura's pink velvet cloak, and they were\nsomehow lifted past the big golden lantern, carried along the passage,\nand pushed into the little room marked \"Ladies.\" Here the crowd was so\ngreat there was hardly space to take off their things; the noise was\ndeafening. Two benches on either side were stacked high with wraps. Two\nold women in white aprons ran up and down tossing fresh armfuls.\nAnd everybody was pressing forward trying to get at the little\ndressing-table and mirror at the far end.\n\nA great quivering jet of gas lighted the ladies' room. It couldn't wait;\nit was dancing already. When the door opened again and there came a\nburst of tuning from the drill hall, it leaped almost to the ceiling.\n\nDark girls, fair girls were patting their hair, tying ribbons again,\ntucking handkerchiefs down the fronts of their bodices, smoothing\nmarble-white gloves. And because they were all laughing it seemed to\nLeila that they were all lovely.\n\n\"Aren't there any invisible hair-pins?\" cried a voice. \"How most\nextraordinary! I can't see a single invisible hair-pin.\"\n\n\"Powder my back, there's a darling,\" cried some one else.\n\n\"But I must have a needle and cotton. I've torn simply miles and miles\nof the frill,\" wailed a third.\n\nThen, \"Pass them along, pass them along!\" The straw basket of programmes\nwas tossed from arm to arm. Darling little pink-and-silver programmes,\nwith pink pencils and fluffy tassels. Leila's fingers shook as she took\none out of the basket. She wanted to ask some one, \"Am I meant to\nhave one too?\" but she had just time to read: \"Waltz 3. 'Two, Two in\na Canoe.' Polka 4. 'Making the Feathers Fly,'\" when Meg cried, \"Ready,\nLeila?\" and they pressed their way through the crush in the passage\ntowards the big double doors of the drill hall.\n\nDancing had not begun yet, but the band had stopped tuning, and the\nnoise was so great it seemed that when it did begin to play it would\nnever be heard. Leila, pressing close to Meg, looking over Meg's\nshoulder, felt that even the little quivering coloured flags strung\nacross the ceiling were talking. She quite forgot to be shy; she forgot\nhow in the middle of dressing she had sat down on the bed with one shoe\noff and one shoe on and begged her mother to ring up her cousins and\nsay she couldn't go after all. And the rush of longing she had had to be\nsitting on the veranda of their forsaken up-country home, listening to\nthe baby owls crying \"More pork\" in the moonlight, was changed to a rush\nof joy so sweet that it was hard to bear alone. She clutched her fan,\nand, gazing at the gleaming, golden floor, the azaleas, the lanterns,\nthe stage at one end with its red carpet and gilt chairs and the band in\na corner, she thought breathlessly, \"How heavenly; how simply heavenly!\"\n\nAll the girls stood grouped together at one side of the doors, the\nmen at the other, and the chaperones in dark dresses, smiling rather\nfoolishly, walked with little careful steps over the polished floor\ntowards the stage.\n\n\"This is my little country cousin Leila. Be nice to her. Find her\npartners; she's under my wing,\" said Meg, going up to one girl after\nanother.\n\nStrange faces smiled at Leila--sweetly, vaguely. Strange voices\nanswered, \"Of course, my dear.\" But Leila felt the girls didn't really\nsee her. They were looking towards the men. Why didn't the men begin?\nWhat were they waiting for? There they stood, smoothing their gloves,\npatting their glossy hair and smiling among themselves. Then, quite\nsuddenly, as if they had only just made up their minds that that was\nwhat they had to do, the men came gliding over the parquet. There was a\njoyful flutter among the girls. A tall, fair man flew up to Meg, seized\nher programme, scribbled something; Meg passed him on to Leila. \"May I\nhave the pleasure?\" He ducked and smiled. There came a dark man wearing\nan eyeglass, then cousin Laurie with a friend, and Laura with a little\nfreckled fellow whose tie was crooked. Then quite an old man--fat, with\na big bald patch on his head--took her programme and murmured, \"Let me\nsee, let me see!\" And he was a long time comparing his programme,\nwhich looked black with names, with hers. It seemed to give him so much\ntrouble that Leila was ashamed. \"Oh, please don't bother,\" she said\neagerly. But instead of replying the fat man wrote something, glanced at\nher again. \"Do I remember this bright little face?\" he said softly. \"Is\nit known to me of yore?\" At that moment the band began playing; the fat\nman disappeared. He was tossed away on a great wave of music that came\nflying over the gleaming floor, breaking the groups up into couples,\nscattering them, sending them spinning...\n\nLeila had learned to dance at boarding school. Every Saturday afternoon\nthe boarders were hurried off to a little corrugated iron mission\nhall where Miss Eccles (of London) held her \"select\" classes. But the\ndifference between that dusty-smelling hall--with calico texts on the\nwalls, the poor terrified little woman in a brown velvet toque with\nrabbit's ears thumping the cold piano, Miss Eccles poking the girls'\nfeet with her long white wand--and this was so tremendous that Leila was\nsure if her partner didn't come and she had to listen to that marvellous\nmusic and to watch the others sliding, gliding over the golden floor,\nshe would die at least, or faint, or lift her arms and fly out of one of\nthose dark windows that showed the stars.\n\n\"Ours, I think--\" Some one bowed, smiled, and offered her his arm; she\nhadn't to die after all. Some one's hand pressed her waist, and she\nfloated away like a flower that is tossed into a pool.\n\n\"Quite a good floor, isn't it?\" drawled a faint voice close to her ear.\n\n\"I think it's most beautifully slippery,\" said Leila.\n\n\"Pardon!\" The faint voice sounded surprised. Leila said it again. And\nthere was a tiny pause before the voice echoed, \"Oh, quite!\" and she was\nswung round again.\n\nHe steered so beautifully. That was the great difference between dancing\nwith girls and men, Leila decided. Girls banged into each other, and\nstamped on each other's feet; the girl who was gentleman always clutched\nyou so.\n\nThe azaleas were separate flowers no longer; they were pink and white\nflags streaming by.\n\n\"Were you at the Bells' last week?\" the voice came again. It sounded\ntired. Leila wondered whether she ought to ask him if he would like to\nstop.\n\n\"No, this is my first dance,\" said she.\n\nHer partner gave a little gasping laugh. \"Oh, I say,\" he protested.\n\n\"Yes, it is really the first dance I've ever been to.\" Leila was most\nfervent. It was such a relief to be able to tell somebody. \"You see,\nI've lived in the country all my life up till now... \"\n\nAt that moment the music stopped, and they went to sit on two chairs\nagainst the wall. Leila tucked her pink satin feet under and fanned\nherself, while she blissfully watched the other couples passing and\ndisappearing through the swing doors.\n\n\"Enjoying yourself, Leila?\" asked Jose, nodding her golden head.\n\nLaura passed and gave her the faintest little wink; it made Leila wonder\nfor a moment whether she was quite grown up after all. Certainly her\npartner did not say very much. He coughed, tucked his handkerchief away,\npulled down his waistcoat, took a minute thread off his sleeve. But\nit didn't matter. Almost immediately the band started and her second\npartner seemed to spring from the ceiling.\n\n\"Floor's not bad,\" said the new voice. Did one always begin with the\nfloor? And then, \"Were you at the Neaves' on Tuesday?\" And again Leila\nexplained. Perhaps it was a little strange that her partners were not\nmore interested. For it was thrilling. Her first ball! She was only at\nthe beginning of everything. It seemed to her that she had never known\nwhat the night was like before. Up till now it had been dark, silent,\nbeautiful very often--oh yes--but mournful somehow. Solemn. And now it\nwould never be like that again--it had opened dazzling bright.\n\n\"Care for an ice?\" said her partner. And they went through the swing\ndoors, down the passage, to the supper room. Her cheeks burned, she was\nfearfully thirsty. How sweet the ices looked on little glass plates and\nhow cold the frosted spoon was, iced too! And when they came back to\nthe hall there was the fat man waiting for her by the door. It gave her\nquite a shock again to see how old he was; he ought to have been on the\nstage with the fathers and mothers. And when Leila compared him with her\nother partners he looked shabby. His waistcoat was creased, there was\na button off his glove, his coat looked as if it was dusty with French\nchalk.\n\n\"Come along, little lady,\" said the fat man. He scarcely troubled to\nclasp her, and they moved away so gently, it was more like walking than\ndancing. But he said not a word about the floor. \"Your first dance,\nisn't it?\" he murmured.\n\n\"How did you know?\"\n\n\"Ah,\" said the fat man, \"that's what it is to be old!\" He wheezed\nfaintly as he steered her past an awkward couple. \"You see, I've been\ndoing this kind of thing for the last thirty years.\"\n\n\"Thirty years?\" cried Leila. Twelve years before she was born!\n\n\"It hardly bears thinking about, does it?\" said the fat man gloomily.\nLeila looked at his bald head, and she felt quite sorry for him.\n\n\"I think it's marvellous to be still going on,\" she said kindly.\n\n\"Kind little lady,\" said the fat man, and he pressed her a little\ncloser, and hummed a bar of the waltz. \"Of course,\" he said, \"you can't\nhope to last anything like as long as that. No-o,\" said the fat man,\n\"long before that you'll be sitting up there on the stage, looking on,\nin your nice black velvet. And these pretty arms will have turned into\nlittle short fat ones, and you'll beat time with such a different kind\nof fan--a black bony one.\" The fat man seemed to shudder. \"And you'll\nsmile away like the poor old dears up there, and point to your daughter,\nand tell the elderly lady next to you how some dreadful man tried to\nkiss her at the club ball. And your heart will ache, ache\"--the fat\nman squeezed her closer still, as if he really was sorry for that\npoor heart--\"because no one wants to kiss you now. And you'll say how\nunpleasant these polished floors are to walk on, how dangerous they are.\nEh, Mademoiselle Twinkletoes?\" said the fat man softly.\n\nLeila gave a light little laugh, but she did not feel like laughing. Was\nit--could it all be true? It sounded terribly true. Was this first ball\nonly the beginning of her last ball, after all? At that the music seemed\nto change; it sounded sad, sad; it rose upon a great sigh. Oh, how\nquickly things changed! Why didn't happiness last for ever? For ever\nwasn't a bit too long.\n\n\"I want to stop,\" she said in a breathless voice. The fat man led her to\nthe door.\n\n\"No,\" she said, \"I won't go outside. I won't sit down. I'll just stand\nhere, thank you.\" She leaned against the wall, tapping with her foot,\npulling up her gloves and trying to smile. But deep inside her a little\ngirl threw her pinafore over her head and sobbed. Why had he spoiled it\nall?\n\n\"I say, you know,\" said the fat man, \"you mustn't take me seriously,\nlittle lady.\"\n\n\"As if I should!\" said Leila, tossing her small dark head and sucking\nher underlip...\n\nAgain the couples paraded. The swing doors opened and shut. Now new\nmusic was given out by the bandmaster. But Leila didn't want to dance\nany more. She wanted to be home, or sitting on the veranda listening to\nthose baby owls. When she looked through the dark windows at the stars,\nthey had long beams like wings...\n\nBut presently a soft, melting, ravishing tune began, and a young man\nwith curly hair bowed before her. She would have to dance, out of\npoliteness, until she could find Meg. Very stiffly she walked into\nthe middle; very haughtily she put her hand on his sleeve. But in one\nminute, in one turn, her feet glided, glided. The lights, the azaleas,\nthe dresses, the pink faces, the velvet chairs, all became one beautiful\nflying wheel. And when her next partner bumped her into the fat man\nand he said, \"Pardon,\" she smiled at him more radiantly than ever. She\ndidn't even recognise him again.\n\n\n\n\n</CHAPTER>\n"}, {"id": 11, "text": "<CHAPTER>\n11. THE SINGING LESSON.\n\nWith despair--cold, sharp despair--buried deep in her heart like a\nwicked knife, Miss Meadows, in cap and gown and carrying a little baton,\ntrod the cold corridors that led to the music hall. Girls of all ages,\nrosy from the air, and bubbling over with that gleeful excitement that\ncomes from running to school on a fine autumn morning, hurried, skipped,\nfluttered by; from the hollow class-rooms came a quick drumming of\nvoices; a bell rang; a voice like a bird cried, \"Muriel.\" And then there\ncame from the staircase a tremendous knock-knock-knocking. Some one had\ndropped her dumbbells.\n\nThe Science Mistress stopped Miss Meadows.\n\n\"Good mor-ning,\" she cried, in her sweet, affected drawl. \"Isn't it\ncold? It might be win-ter.\"\n\nMiss Meadows, hugging the knife, stared in hatred at the Science\nMistress. Everything about her was sweet, pale, like honey. You wold not\nhave been surprised to see a bee caught in the tangles of that yellow\nhair.\n\n\"It is rather sharp,\" said Miss Meadows, grimly.\n\nThe other smiled her sugary smile.\n\n\"You look fro-zen,\" said she. Her blue eyes opened wide; there came a\nmocking light in them. (Had she noticed anything?)\n\n\"Oh, not quite as bad as that,\" said Miss Meadows, and she gave the\nScience Mistress, in exchange for her smile, a quick grimace and passed\non...\n\nForms Four, Five, and Six were assembled in the music hall. The noise\nwas deafening. On the platform, by the piano, stood Mary Beazley, Miss\nMeadows' favourite, who played accompaniments. She was turning the\nmusic stool. When she saw Miss Meadows she gave a loud, warning \"Sh-sh!\ngirls!\" and Miss Meadows, her hands thrust in her sleeves, the baton\nunder her arm, strode down the centre aisle, mounted the steps, turned\nsharply, seized the brass music stand, planted it in front of her, and\ngave two sharp taps with her baton for silence.\n\n\"Silence, please! Immediately!\" and, looking at nobody, her glance swept\nover that sea of coloured flannel blouses, with bobbing pink faces and\nhands, quivering butterfly hair-bows, and music-books outspread. She\nknew perfectly well what they were thinking. \"Meady is in a wax.\" Well,\nlet them think it! Her eyelids quivered; she tossed her head, defying\nthem. What could the thoughts of those creatures matter to some one who\nstood there bleeding to death, pierced to the heart, to the heart, by\nsuch a letter--\n\n... \"I feel more and more strongly that our marriage would be a mistake.\nNot that I do not love you. I love you as much as it is possible for\nme to love any woman, but, truth to tell, I have come to the conclusion\nthat I am not a marrying man, and the idea of settling down fills me\nwith nothing but--\" and the word \"disgust\" was scratched out lightly and\n\"regret\" written over the top.\n\nBasil! Miss Meadows stalked over to the piano. And Mary Beazley, who was\nwaiting for this moment, bent forward; her curls fell over her cheeks\nwhile she breathed, \"Good morning, Miss Meadows,\" and she motioned\ntowards rather than handed to her mistress a beautiful yellow\nchrysanthemum. This little ritual of the flower had been gone through\nfor ages and ages, quite a term and a half. It was as much part of the\nlesson as opening the piano. But this morning, instead of taking it up,\ninstead of tucking it into her belt while she leant over Mary and said,\n\"Thank you, Mary. How very nice! Turn to page thirty-two,\" what was\nMary's horror when Miss Meadows totally ignored the chrysanthemum, made\nno reply to her greeting, but said in a voice of ice, \"Page fourteen,\nplease, and mark the accents well.\"\n\nStaggering moment! Mary blushed until the tears stood in her eyes, but\nMiss Meadows was gone back to the music stand; her voice rang through\nthe music hall.\n\n\"Page fourteen. We will begin with page fourteen. 'A Lament.' Now,\ngirls, you ought to know it by this time. We shall take it all together;\nnot in parts, all together. And without expression. Sing it, though,\nquite simply, beating time with the left hand.\"\n\nShe raised the baton; she tapped the music stand twice. Down came Mary\non the opening chord; down came all those left hands, beating the air,\nand in chimed those young, mournful voices:--\n\n     \"Fast!  Ah, too Fast Fade the Ro-o-ses of Pleasure;\n        Soon Autumn yields unto Wi-i-nter Drear.\n      Fleetly!  Ah, Fleetly Mu-u-sic's Gay Measure\n        Passes away from the Listening Ear.\"\n\nGood Heavens, what could be more tragic than that lament! Every note was\na sigh, a sob, a groan of awful mournfulness. Miss Meadows lifted her\narms in the wide gown and began conducting with both hands. \"... I feel\nmore and more strongly that our marriage would be a mistake... \" she\nbeat. And the voices cried: \"Fleetly! Ah, Fleetly.\" What could have\npossessed him to write such a letter! What could have led up to it!\nIt came out of nothing. His last letter had been all about a fumed-oak\nbookcase he had bought for \"our\" books, and a \"natty little hall-stand\"\nhe had seen, \"a very neat affair with a carved owl on a bracket, holding\nthree hat-brushes in its claws.\" How she had smiled at that! So like\na man to think one needed three hat-brushes! \"From the Listening Ear,\"\nsang the voices.\n\n\"Once again,\" said Miss Meadows. \"But this time in parts. Still without\nexpression.\" \"Fast! Ah, too Fast.\" With the gloom of the contraltos\nadded, one could scarcely help shuddering. \"Fade the Roses of Pleasure.\"\nLast time he had come to see her, Basil had worn a rose in his\nbuttonhole. How handsome he had looked in that bright blue suit, with\nthat dark red rose! And he knew it, too. He couldn't help knowing it.\nFirst he stroked his hair, then his moustache; his teeth gleamed when he\nsmiled.\n\n\"The headmaster's wife keeps on asking me to dinner. It's a perfect\nnuisance. I never get an evening to myself in that place.\"\n\n\"But can't you refuse?\"\n\n\"Oh, well, it doesn't do for a man in my position to be unpopular.\"\n\n\"Music's Gay Measure,\" wailed the voices. The willow trees, outside\nthe high, narrow windows, waved in the wind. They had lost half their\nleaves. The tiny ones that clung wriggled like fishes caught on a\nline. \"... I am not a marrying man... \" The voices were silent; the piano\nwaited.\n\n\"Quite good,\" said Miss Meadows, but still in such a strange, stony tone\nthat the younger girls began to feel positively frightened. \"But now\nthat we know it, we shall take it with expression. As much expression as\nyou can put into it. Think of the words, girls. Use your imaginations.\n'Fast! Ah, too Fast,'\" cried Miss Meadows. \"That ought to break out--a\nloud, strong forte--a lament. And then in the second line, 'Winter\nDrear,' make that 'Drear' sound as if a cold wind were blowing through\nit. 'Dre-ear!'\" said she so awfully that Mary Beazley, on the music\nstool, wriggled her spine. \"The third line should be one crescendo.\n'Fleetly! Ah, Fleetly Music's Gay Measure.' Breaking on the first word\nof the last line, Passes.' And then on the word, 'Away,' you must begin\nto die... to fade... until 'The Listening Ear' is nothing more than a\nfaint whisper... You can slow down as much as you like almost on the last\nline. Now, please.\"\n\nAgain the two light taps; she lifted her arms again. 'Fast! Ah, too\nFast.' \"... and the idea of settling down fills me with nothing but\ndisgust--\" Disgust was what he had written. That was as good as to\nsay their engagement was definitely broken off. Broken off! Their\nengagement! People had been surprised enough that she had got engaged.\nThe Science Mistress would not believe it at first. But nobody had been\nas surprised as she. She was thirty. Basil was twenty-five. It had been\na miracle, simply a miracle, to hear him say, as they walked home from\nchurch that very dark night, \"You know, somehow or other, I've got fond\nof you.\" And he had taken hold of the end of her ostrich feather boa.\n\"Passes away from the Listening Ear.\"\n\n\"Repeat! Repeat!\" said Miss Meadows. \"More expression, girls! Once\nmore!\"\n\n\"Fast! Ah, too Fast.\" The older girls were crimson; some of the younger\nones began to cry. Big spots of rain blew against the windows, and one\ncould hear the willows whispering, \"... not that I do not love you... \"\n\n\"But, my darling, if you love me,\" thought Miss Meadows, \"I don't mind\nhow much it is. Love me as little as you like.\" But she knew he didn't\nlove her. Not to have cared enough to scratch out that word \"disgust,\"\nso that she couldn't read it! \"Soon Autumn yields unto Winter Drear.\"\nShe would have to leave the school, too. She could never face the\nScience Mistress or the girls after it got known. She would have to\ndisappear somewhere. \"Passes away.\" The voices began to die, to fade, to\nwhisper... to vanish...\n\nSuddenly the door opened. A little girl in blue walked fussily up the\naisle, hanging her head, biting her lips, and twisting the silver bangle\non her red little wrist. She came up the steps and stood before Miss\nMeadows.\n\n\"Well, Monica, what is it?\"\n\n\"Oh, if you please, Miss Meadows,\" said the little girl, gasping, \"Miss\nWyatt wants to see you in the mistress's room.\"\n\n\"Very well,\" said Miss Meadows. And she called to the girls, \"I shall\nput you on your honour to talk quietly while I am away.\" But they were\ntoo subdued to do anything else. Most of them were blowing their noses.\n\nThe corridors were silent and cold; they echoed to Miss Meadows' steps.\nThe head mistress sat at her desk. For a moment she did not look up. She\nwas as usual disentangling her eyeglasses, which had got caught in her\nlace tie. \"Sit down, Miss Meadows,\" she said very kindly. And then she\npicked up a pink envelope from the blotting-pad. \"I sent for you just\nnow because this telegram has come for you.\"\n\n\"A telegram for me, Miss Wyatt?\"\n\nBasil! He had committed suicide, decided Miss Meadows. Her hand flew\nout, but Miss Wyatt held the telegram back a moment. \"I hope it's not\nbad news,\" she said, so more than kindly. And Miss Meadows tore it open.\n\n\"Pay no attention to letter, must have been mad, bought hat-stand\nto-day--Basil,\" she read. She couldn't take her eyes off the telegram.\n\n\"I do hope it's nothing very serious,\" said Miss Wyatt, leaning forward.\n\n\"Oh, no, thank you, Miss Wyatt,\" blushed Miss Meadows. \"It's nothing bad\nat all. It's\"--and she gave an apologetic little laugh--\"it's from my\nfiance saying that... saying that--\" There was a pause. \"I see,\" said\nMiss Wyatt. And another pause. Then--\"You've fifteen minutes more of\nyour class, Miss Meadows, haven't you?\"\n\n\"Yes, Miss Wyatt.\" She got up. She half ran towards the door.\n\n\"Oh, just one minute, Miss Meadows,\" said Miss Wyatt. \"I must say I\ndon't approve of my teachers having telegrams sent to them in school\nhours, unless in case of very bad news, such as death,\" explained Miss\nWyatt, \"or a very serious accident, or something to that effect. Good\nnews, Miss Meadows, will always keep, you know.\"\n\nOn the wings of hope, of love, of joy, Miss Meadows sped back to the\nmusic hall, up the aisle, up the steps, over to the piano.\n\n\"Page thirty-two, Mary,\" she said, \"page thirty-two,\" and, picking up\nthe yellow chrysanthemum, she held it to her lips to hide her smile.\nThen she turned to the girls, rapped with her baton: \"Page thirty-two,\ngirls. Page thirty-two.\"\n\n     \"We come here To-day with Flowers o'erladen,\n      With Baskets of Fruit and Ribbons to boot,\n      To-oo Congratulate...\n\n\"Stop! Stop!\" cried Miss Meadows. \"This is awful. This is dreadful.\" And\nshe beamed at her girls. \"What's the matter with you all? Think, girls,\nthink of what you're singing. Use your imaginations. 'With Flowers\no'erladen. Baskets of Fruit and Ribbons to boot.' And 'Congratulate.'\"\nMiss Meadows broke off. \"Don't look so doleful, girls. It ought to sound\nwarm, joyful, eager. 'Congratulate.' Once more. Quickly. All together.\nNow then!\"\n\nAnd this time Miss Meadows' voice sounded over all the other\nvoices--full, deep, glowing with expression.\n\n\n\n\n</CHAPTER>\n"}, {"id": 12, "text": "<CHAPTER>\n12. THE STRANGER\n\nIt seemed to the little crowd on the wharf that she was never going\nto move again. There she lay, immense, motionless on the grey crinkled\nwater, a loop of smoke above her, an immense flock of gulls screaming\nand diving after the galley droppings at the stern. You could just see\nlittle couples parading--little flies walking up and down the dish on\nthe grey crinkled tablecloth. Other flies clustered and swarmed at the\nedge. Now there was a gleam of white on the lower deck--the cook's apron\nor the stewardess perhaps. Now a tiny black spider raced up the ladder\non to the bridge.\n\nIn the front of the crowd a strong-looking, middle-aged man, dressed\nvery well, very snugly in a grey overcoat, grey silk scarf, thick gloves\nand dark felt hat, marched up and down, twirling his folded umbrella. He\nseemed to be the leader of the little crowd on the wharf and at the same\ntime to keep them together. He was something between the sheep-dog and\nthe shepherd.\n\nBut what a fool--what a fool he had been not to bring any glasses! There\nwasn't a pair of glasses between the whole lot of them.\n\n\"Curious thing, Mr. Scott, that none of us thought of glasses. We might\nhave been able to stir 'em up a bit. We might have managed a little\nsignalling. 'Don't hesitate to land. Natives harmless.' Or: 'A welcome\nawaits you. All is forgiven.' What? Eh?\"\n\nMr. Hammond's quick, eager glance, so nervous and yet so friendly and\nconfiding, took in everybody on the wharf, roped in even those old chaps\nlounging against the gangways. They knew, every man-jack of them, that\nMrs. Hammond was on that boat, and that he was so tremendously excited\nit never entered his head not to believe that this marvellous fact meant\nsomething to them too. It warmed his heart towards them. They were,\nhe decided, as decent a crowd of people--Those old chaps over by the\ngangways, too--fine, solid old chaps. What chests--by Jove! And he\nsquared his own, plunged his thick-gloved hands into his pockets, rocked\nfrom heel to toe.\n\n\"Yes, my wife's been in Europe for the last ten months. On a visit to\nour eldest girl, who was married last year. I brought her up here, as\nfar as Salisbury, myself. So I thought I'd better come and fetch her\nback. Yes, yes, yes.\" The shrewd grey eyes narrowed again and searched\nanxiously, quickly, the motionless liner. Again his overcoat was\nunbuttoned. Out came the thin, butter-yellow watch again, and for the\ntwentieth--fiftieth--hundredth time he made the calculation.\n\n\"Let me see now. It was two fifteen when the doctor's launch went off.\nTwo fifteen. It is now exactly twenty-eight minutes past four. That is\nto say, the doctor's been gone two hours and thirteen minutes. Two hours\nand thirteen minutes! Whee-ooh!\" He gave a queer little half-whistle\nand snapped his watch to again. \"But I think we should have been told if\nthere was anything up--don't you, Mr. Gaven?\"\n\n\"Oh, yes, Mr. Hammond! I don't think there's anything to--anything to\nworry about,\" said Mr. Gaven, knocking out his pipe against the heel of\nhis shoe. \"At the same time--\"\n\n\"Quite so! Quite so!\" cried Mr. Hammond. \"Dashed annoying!\" He paced\nquickly up and down and came back again to his stand between Mr. and\nMrs. Scott and Mr. Gaven. \"It's getting quite dark, too,\" and he waved\nhis folded umbrella as though the dusk at least might have had the\ndecency to keep off for a bit. But the dusk came slowly, spreading like\na slow stain over the water. Little Jean Scott dragged at her mother's\nhand.\n\n\"I wan' my tea, mammy!\" she wailed.\n\n\"I expect you do,\" said Mr. Hammond. \"I expect all these ladies want\ntheir tea.\" And his kind, flushed, almost pitiful glance roped them all\nin again. He wondered whether Janey was having a final cup of tea in the\nsaloon out there. He hoped so; he thought not. It would be just like her\nnot to leave the deck. In that case perhaps the deck steward would bring\nher up a cup. If he'd been there he'd have got it for her--somehow. And\nfor a moment he was on deck, standing over her, watching her little hand\nfold round the cup in the way she had, while she drank the only cup of\ntea to be got on board... But now he was back here, and the Lord only\nknew when that cursed Captain would stop hanging about in the stream.\nHe took another turn, up and down, up and down. He walked as far as the\ncab-stand to make sure his driver hadn't disappeared; back he swerved\nagain to the little flock huddled in the shelter of the banana crates.\nLittle Jean Scott was still wanting her tea. Poor little beggar! He\nwished he had a bit of chocolate on him.\n\n\"Here, Jean!\" he said. \"Like a lift up?\" And easily, gently, he swung\nthe little girl on to a higher barrel. The movement of holding her,\nsteadying her, relieved him wonderfully, lightened his heart.\n\n\"Hold on,\" he said, keeping an arm round her.\n\n\"Oh, don't worry about Jean, Mr. Hammond!\" said Mrs. Scott.\n\n\"That's all right, Mrs. Scott. No trouble. It's a pleasure. Jean's a\nlittle pal of mine, aren't you, Jean?\"\n\n\"Yes, Mr. Hammond,\" said Jean, and she ran her finger down the dent of\nhis felt hat.\n\nBut suddenly she caught him by the ear and gave a loud scream. \"Lo-ok,\nMr. Hammond! She's moving! Look, she's coming in!\"\n\nBy Jove! So she was. At last! She was slowly, slowly turning round. A\nbell sounded far over the water and a great spout of steam gushed into\nthe air. The gulls rose; they fluttered away like bits of white paper.\nAnd whether that deep throbbing was her engines or his heart Mr. Hammond\ncouldn't say. He had to nerve himself to bear it, whatever it was. At\nthat moment old Captain Johnson, the harbour-master, came striding down\nthe wharf, a leather portfolio under his arm.\n\n\"Jean'll be all right,\" said Mr. Scott. \"I'll hold her.\" He was just in\ntime. Mr. Hammond had forgotten about Jean. He sprang away to greet old\nCaptain Johnson.\n\n\"Well, Captain,\" the eager, nervous voice rang out again, \"you've taken\npity on us at last.\"\n\n\"It's no good blaming me, Mr. Hammond,\" wheezed old Captain Johnson,\nstaring at the liner. \"You got Mrs. Hammond on board, ain't yer?\"\n\n\"Yes, yes!\" said Hammond, and he kept by the harbour-master's side.\n\"Mrs. Hammond's there. Hul-lo! We shan't be long now!\"\n\nWith her telephone ring-ringing, the thrum of her screw filling the air,\nthe big liner bore down on them, cutting sharp through the dark water\nso that big white shavings curled to either side. Hammond and the\nharbour-master kept in front of the rest. Hammond took off his hat; he\nraked the decks--they were crammed with passengers; he waved his hat and\nbawled a loud, strange \"Hul-lo!\" across the water; and then turned\nround and burst out laughing and said something--nothing--to old Captain\nJohnson.\n\n\"Seen her?\" asked the harbour-master.\n\n\"No, not yet. Steady--wait a bit!\" And suddenly, between two great\nclumsy idiots--\"Get out of the way there!\" he signed with his\numbrella--he saw a hand raised--a white glove shaking a handkerchief.\nAnother moment, and--thank God, thank God!--there she was. There was\nJaney. There was Mrs. Hammond, yes, yes, yes--standing by the rail and\nsmiling and nodding and waving her handkerchief.\n\n\"Well that's first class--first class! Well, well, well!\" He positively\nstamped. Like lightning he drew out his cigar-case and offered it to\nold Captain Johnson. \"Have a cigar, Captain! They're pretty good. Have\na couple! Here\"--and he pressed all the cigars in the case on the\nharbour-master--\"I've a couple of boxes up at the hotel.\"\n\n\"Thenks, Mr. Hammond!\" wheezed old Captain Johnson.\n\nHammond stuffed the cigar-case back. His hands were shaking, but he'd\ngot hold of himself again. He was able to face Janey. There she was,\nleaning on the rail, talking to some woman and at the same time watching\nhim, ready for him. It struck him, as the gulf of water closed, how\nsmall she looked on that huge ship. His heart was wrung with such a\nspasm that he could have cried out. How little she looked to have come\nall that long way and back by herself! Just like her, though. Just like\nJaney. She had the courage of a--And now the crew had come forward and\nparted the passengers; they had lowered the rails for the gangways.\n\nThe voices on shore and the voices on board flew to greet each other.\n\n\"All well?\"\n\n\"All well.\"\n\n\"How's mother?\"\n\n\"Much better.\"\n\n\"Hullo, Jean!\"\n\n\"Hillo, Aun' Emily!\"\n\n\"Had a good voyage?\"\n\n\"Splendid!\"\n\n\"Shan't be long now!\"\n\n\"Not long now.\"\n\nThe engines stopped. Slowly she edged to the wharf-side.\n\n\"Make way there--make way--make way!\" And the wharf hands brought the\nheavy gangways along at a sweeping run. Hammond signed to Janey to stay\nwhere she was. The old harbour-master stepped forward; he followed. As\nto \"ladies first,\" or any rot like that, it never entered his head.\n\n\"After you, Captain!\" he cried genially. And, treading on the old man's\nheels, he strode up the gangway on to the deck in a bee-line to Janey,\nand Janey was clasped in his arms.\n\n\"Well, well, well! Yes, yes! Here we are at last!\" he stammered. It was\nall he could say. And Janey emerged, and her cool little voice--the only\nvoice in the world for him--said,\n\n\"Well, darling! Have you been waiting long?\"\n\nNo; not long. Or, at any rate, it didn't matter. It was over now. But\nthe point was, he had a cab waiting at the end of the wharf. Was she\nready to go off. Was her luggage ready? In that case they could cut off\nsharp with her cabin luggage and let the rest go hang until to-morrow.\nHe bent over her and she looked up with her familiar half-smile. She\nwas just the same. Not a day changed. Just as he'd always known her. She\nlaid her small hand on his sleeve.\n\n\"How are the children, John?\" she asked.\n\n(Hang the children!) \"Perfectly well. Never better in their lives.\"\n\n\"Haven't they sent me letters?\"\n\n\"Yes, yes--of course! I've left them at the hotel for you to digest\nlater on.\"\n\n\"We can't go quite so fast,\" said she. \"I've got people to say good-bye\nto--and then there's the Captain.\" As his face fell she gave his arm a\nsmall understanding squeeze. \"If the Captain comes off the bridge I\nwant you to thank him for having looked after your wife so beautifully.\"\nWell, he'd got her. If she wanted another ten minutes--As he gave way\nshe was surrounded. The whole first-class seemed to want to say good-bye\nto Janey.\n\n\"Good-bye, dear Mrs. Hammond! And next time you're in Sydney I'll expect\nyou.\"\n\n\"Darling Mrs. Hammond! You won't forget to write to me, will you?\"\n\n\"Well, Mrs. Hammond, what this boat would have been without you!\"\n\nIt was as plain as a pikestaff that she was by far the most popular\nwoman on board. And she took it all--just as usual. Absolutely composed.\nJust her little self--just Janey all over; standing there with her veil\nthrown back. Hammond never noticed what his wife had on. It was all the\nsame to him whatever she wore. But to-day he did notice that she wore a\nblack \"costume\"--didn't they call it?--with white frills, trimmings he\nsupposed they were, at the neck and sleeves. All this while Janey handed\nhim round.\n\n\"John, dear!\" And then: \"I want to introduce you to--\"\n\nFinally they did escape, and she led the way to her state-room. To\nfollow Janey down the passage that she knew so well--that was so strange\nto him; to part the green curtains after her and to step into the cabin\nthat had been hers gave him exquisite happiness. But--confound it!--the\nstewardess was there on the floor, strapping up the rugs.\n\n\"That's the last, Mrs. Hammond,\" said the stewardess, rising and pulling\ndown her cuffs.\n\nHe was introduced again, and then Janey and the stewardess disappeared\ninto the passage. He heard whisperings. She was getting the tipping\nbusiness over, he supposed. He sat down on the striped sofa and took his\nhat off. There were the rugs she had taken with her; they looked good as\nnew. All her luggage looked fresh, perfect. The labels were written in\nher beautiful little clear hand--\"Mrs. John Hammond.\"\n\n\"Mrs. John Hammond!\" He gave a long sigh of content and leaned back,\ncrossing his arms. The strain was over. He felt he could have sat there\nfor ever sighing his relief--the relief at being rid of that horrible\ntug, pull, grip on his heart. The danger was over. That was the feeling.\nThey were on dry land again.\n\nBut at that moment Janey's head came round the corner.\n\n\"Darling--do you mind? I just want to go and say good-bye to the\ndoctor.\"\n\nHammond started up. \"I'll come with you.\"\n\n\"No, no!\" she said. \"Don't bother. I'd rather not. I'll not be a\nminute.\"\n\nAnd before he could answer she was gone. He had half a mind to run after\nher; but instead he sat down again.\n\nWould she really not be long? What was the time now? Out came the watch;\nhe stared at nothing. That was rather queer of Janey, wasn't it? Why\ncouldn't she have told the stewardess to say good-bye for her? Why did\nshe have to go chasing after the ship's doctor? She could have sent\na note from the hotel even if the affair had been urgent. Urgent? Did\nit--could it mean that she had been ill on the voyage--she was keeping\nsomething from him? That was it! He seized his hat. He was going off\nto find that fellow and to wring the truth out of him at all costs. He\nthought he'd noticed just something. She was just a touch too calm--too\nsteady. From the very first moment--\n\nThe curtains rang. Janey was back. He jumped to his feet.\n\n\"Janey, have you been ill on this voyage? You have!\"\n\n\"Ill?\" Her airy little voice mocked him. She stepped over the rugs, and\ncame up close, touched his breast, and looked up at him.\n\n\"Darling,\" she said, \"don't frighten me. Of course I haven't! Whatever\nmakes you think I have? Do I look ill?\"\n\nBut Hammond didn't see her. He only felt that she was looking at him\nand that there was no need to worry about anything. She was here to look\nafter things. It was all right. Everything was.\n\nThe gentle pressure of her hand was so calming that he put his over hers\nto hold it there. And she said:\n\n\"Stand still. I want to look at you. I haven't seen you yet. You've\nhad your beard beautifully trimmed, and you look--younger, I think, and\ndecidedly thinner! Bachelor life agrees with you.\"\n\n\"Agrees with me!\" He groaned for love and caught her close again. And\nagain, as always, he had the feeling that he was holding something that\nnever was quite his--his. Something too delicate, too precious, that\nwould fly away once he let go.\n\n\"For God's sake let's get off to the hotel so that we can be by\nourselves!\" And he rang the bell hard for some one to look sharp with\nthe luggage.\n\n*****\n\nWalking down the wharf together she took his arm. He had her on his arm\nagain. And the difference it made to get into the cab after Janey--to\nthrow the red-and-yellow striped blanket round them both--to tell the\ndriver to hurry because neither of them had had any tea. No more going\nwithout his tea or pouring out his own. She was back. He turned to her,\nsqueezed her hand, and said gently, teasingly, in the \"special\" voice\nhe had for her: \"Glad to be home again, dearie?\" She smiled; she didn't\neven bother to answer, but gently she drew his hand away as they came to\nthe brighter streets.\n\n\"We've got the best room in the hotel,\" he said. \"I wouldn't be put off\nwith another. And I asked the chambermaid to put in a bit of a fire in\ncase you felt chilly. She's a nice, attentive girl. And I thought now\nwe were here we wouldn't bother to go home to-morrow, but spend the day\nlooking round and leave the morning after. Does that suit you? There's\nno hurry, is there? The children will have you soon enough... I thought a\nday's sight-seeing might make a nice break in your journey--eh, Janey?\"\n\n\"Have you taken the tickets for the day after?\" she asked.\n\n\"I should think I have!\" He unbuttoned his overcoat and took out his\nbulging pocket-book. \"Here we are! I reserved a first-class carriage to\nCooktown. There it is--'Mr. and Mrs. John Hammond.' I thought we might\nas well do ourselves comfortably, and we don't want other people butting\nin, do we? But if you'd like to stop here a bit longer--?\"\n\n\"Oh, no!\" said Janey quickly. \"Not for the world! The day after\nto-morrow, then. And the children--\"\n\nBut they had reached the hotel. The manager was standing in the broad,\nbrilliantly-lighted porch. He came down to greet them. A porter ran from\nthe hall for their boxes.\n\n\"Well, Mr. Arnold, here's Mrs. Hammond at last!\"\n\nThe manager led them through the hall himself and pressed the\nelevator-bell. Hammond knew there were business pals of his sitting at\nthe little hall tables having a drink before dinner. But he wasn't going\nto risk interruption; he looked neither to the right nor the left. They\ncould think what they pleased. If they didn't understand, the more fools\nthey--and he stepped out of the lift, unlocked the door of their room,\nand shepherded Janey in. The door shut. Now, at last, they were alone\ntogether. He turned up the light. The curtains were drawn; the fire\nblazed. He flung his hat on to the huge bed and went towards her.\n\nBut--would you believe it!--again they were interrupted. This time it\nwas the porter with the luggage. He made two journeys of it, leaving the\ndoor open in between, taking his time, whistling through his teeth\nin the corridor. Hammond paced up and down the room, tearing off his\ngloves, tearing off his scarf. Finally he flung his overcoat on to the\nbedside.\n\nAt last the fool was gone. The door clicked. Now they were alone. Said\nHammond: \"I feel I'll never have you to myself again. These cursed\npeople! Janey\"--and he bent his flushed, eager gaze upon her--\"let's\nhave dinner up here. If we go down to the restaurant we'll be\ninterrupted, and then there's the confounded music\" (the music he'd\npraised so highly, applauded so loudly last night!). \"We shan't be able\nto hear each other speak. Let's have something up here in front of the\nfire. It's too late for tea. I'll order a little supper, shall I? How\ndoes that idea strike you?\"\n\n\"Do, darling!\" said Janey. \"And while you're away--the children's\nletters--\"\n\n\"Oh, later on will do!\" said Hammond.\n\n\"But then we'd get it over,\" said Janey. \"And I'd first have time to--\"\n\n\"Oh, I needn't go down!\" explained Hammond. \"I'll just ring and give the\norder... you don't want to send me away, do you?\"\n\nJaney shook her head and smiled.\n\n\"But you're thinking of something else. You're worrying about\nsomething,\" said Hammond. \"What is it? Come and sit here--come and sit\non my knee before the fire.\"\n\n\"I'll just unpin my hat,\" said Janey, and she went over to the\ndressing-table. \"A-ah!\" She gave a little cry.\n\n\"What is it?\"\n\n\"Nothing, darling. I've just found the children's letters. That's all\nright! They will keep. No hurry now!\" She turned to him, clasping them.\nShe tucked them into her frilled blouse. She cried quickly, gaily: \"Oh,\nhow typical this dressing-table is of you!\"\n\n\"Why? What's the matter with it?\" said Hammond.\n\n\"If it were floating in eternity I should say 'John!'\" laughed\nJaney, staring at the big bottle of hair tonic, the wicker bottle of\neau-de-Cologne, the two hair-brushes, and a dozen new collars tied with\npink tape. \"Is this all your luggage?\"\n\n\"Hang my luggage!\" said Hammond; but all the same he liked being laughed\nat by Janey. \"Let's talk. Let's get down to things. Tell me\"--and as\nJaney perched on his knees he leaned back and drew her into the deep,\nugly chair--\"tell me you're really glad to be back, Janey.\"\n\n\"Yes, darling, I am glad,\" she said.\n\nBut just as when he embraced her he felt she would fly away, so Hammond\nnever knew--never knew for dead certain that she was as glad as he\nwas. How could he know? Would he ever know? Would he always have this\ncraving--this pang like hunger, somehow, to make Janey so much part\nof him that there wasn't any of her to escape? He wanted to blot out\neverybody, everything. He wished now he'd turned off the light. That\nmight have brought her nearer. And now those letters from the children\nrustled in her blouse. He could have chucked them into the fire.\n\n\"Janey,\" he whispered.\n\n\"Yes, dear?\" She lay on his breast, but so lightly, so remotely. Their\nbreathing rose and fell together.\n\n\"Janey!\"\n\n\"What is it?\"\n\n\"Turn to me,\" he whispered. A slow, deep flush flowed into his forehead.\n\"Kiss me, Janey! You kiss me!\"\n\nIt seemed to him there was a tiny pause--but long enough for him to\nsuffer torture--before her lips touched his, firmly, lightly--kissing\nthem as she always kissed him, as though the kiss--how could he describe\nit?--confirmed what they were saying, signed the contract. But that\nwasn't what he wanted; that wasn't at all what he thirsted for. He felt\nsuddenly, horrible tired.\n\n\"If you knew,\" he said, opening his eyes, \"what it's been like--waiting\nto-day. I thought the boat never would come in. There we were, hanging\nabout. What kept you so long?\"\n\nShe made no answer. She was looking away from him at the fire. The\nflames hurried--hurried over the coals, flickered, fell.\n\n\"Not asleep, are you?\" said Hammond, and he jumped her up and down.\n\n\"No,\" she said. And then: \"Don't do that, dear. No, I was thinking. As\na matter of fact,\" she said, \"one of the passengers died last night--a\nman. That's what held us up. We brought him in--I mean, he wasn't buried\nat sea. So, of course, the ship's doctor and the shore doctor--\"\n\n\"What was it?\" asked Hammond uneasily. He hated to hear of death. He\nhated this to have happened. It was, in some queer way, as though he and\nJaney had met a funeral on their way to the hotel.\n\n\"Oh, it wasn't anything in the least infectious!\" said Janey. She was\nspeaking scarcely above her breath. \"It was heart.\" A pause. \"Poor\nfellow!\" she said. \"Quite young.\" And she watched the fire flicker and\nfall. \"He died in my arms,\" said Janey.\n\nThe blow was so sudden that Hammond thought he would faint. He couldn't\nmove; he couldn't breathe. He felt all his strength flowing--flowing\ninto the big dark chair, and the big dark chair held him fast, gripped\nhim, forced him to bear it.\n\n\"What?\" he said dully. \"What's that you say?\"\n\n\"The end was quite peaceful,\" said the small voice. \"He just\"--and\nHammond saw her lift her gentle hand--\"breathed his life away at the\nend.\" And her hand fell.\n\n\"Who--else was there?\" Hammond managed to ask.\n\n\"Nobody. I was alone with him.\"\n\nAh, my God, what was she saying! What was she doing to him! This would\nkill him! And all the while she spoke:\n\n\"I saw the change coming and I sent the steward for the doctor, but the\ndoctor was too late. He couldn't have done anything, anyway.\"\n\n\"But--why you, why you?\" moaned Hammond.\n\nAt that Janey turned quickly, quickly searched his face.\n\n\"You don't mind, John, do you?\" she asked. \"You don't--It's nothing to\ndo with you and me.\"\n\nSomehow or other he managed to shake some sort of smile at her. Somehow\nor other he stammered: \"No--go--on, go on! I want you to tell me.\"\n\n\"But, John darling--\"\n\n\"Tell me, Janey!\"\n\n\"There's nothing to tell,\" she said, wondering. \"He was one of\nthe first-class passengers. I saw he was very ill when he came on\nboard... But he seemed to be so much better until yesterday. He had a\nsevere attack in the afternoon--excitement--nervousness, I think, about\narriving. And after that he never recovered.\"\n\n\"But why didn't the stewardess--\"\n\n\"Oh, my dear--the stewardess!\" said Janey. \"What would he have felt? And\nbesides... he might have wanted to leave a message... to--\"\n\n\"Didn't he?\" muttered Hammond. \"Didn't he say anything?\"\n\n\"No, darling, not a word!\" She shook her head softly. \"All the time I\nwas with him he was too weak... he was too weak even to move a finger... \"\n\nJaney was silent. But her words, so light, so soft, so chill, seemed to\nhover in the air, to rain into his breast like snow.\n\nThe fire had gone red. Now it fell in with a sharp sound and the\nroom was colder. Cold crept up his arms. The room was huge, immense,\nglittering. It filled his whole world. There was the great blind bed,\nwith his coat flung across it like some headless man saying his prayers.\nThere was the luggage, ready to be carried away again, anywhere, tossed\ninto trains, carted on to boats.\n\n... \"He was too weak. He was too weak to move a finger.\" And yet he died\nin Janey's arms. She--who'd never--never once in all these years--never\non one single solitary occasion--\n\nNo; he mustn't think of it. Madness lay in thinking of it. No, he\nwouldn't face it. He couldn't stand it. It was too much to bear!\n\nAnd now Janey touched his tie with her fingers. She pinched the edges of\nthe tie together.\n\n\"You're not--sorry I told you, John darling? It hasn't made you sad? It\nhasn't spoilt our evening--our being alone together?\"\n\nBut at that he had to hide his face. He put his face into her bosom and\nhis arms enfolded her.\n\nSpoilt their evening! Spoilt their being alone together! They would\nnever be alone together again.\n\n\n\n\n</CHAPTER>\n"}, {"id": 13, "text": "<CHAPTER>\n13. BANK HOLIDAY.\n\nA stout man with a pink face wears dingy white flannel trousers, a blue\ncoat with a pink handkerchief showing, and a straw hat much too small\nfor him, perched at the back of his head. He plays the guitar. A little\nchap in white canvas shoes, his face hidden under a felt hat like\na broken wing, breathes into a flute; and a tall thin fellow, with\nbursting over-ripe button boots, draws ribbons--long, twisted, streaming\nribbons--of tune out of a fiddle. They stand, unsmiling, but not\nserious, in the broad sunlight opposite the fruit-shop; the pink\nspider of a hand beats the guitar, the little squat hand, with a\nbrass-and-turquoise ring, forces the reluctant flute, and the fiddler's\narm tries to saw the fiddle in two.\n\nA crowd collects, eating oranges and bananas, tearing off the skins,\ndividing, sharing. One young girl has even a basket of strawberries,\nbut she does not eat them. \"Aren't they dear!\" She stares at the tiny\npointed fruits as if she were afraid of them. The Australian soldier\nlaughs. \"Here, go on, there's not more than a mouthful.\" But he doesn't\nwant her to eat them, either. He likes to watch her little frightened\nface, and her puzzled eyes lifted to his: \"Aren't they a price!\" He\npushes out his chest and grins. Old fat women in velvet bodices--old\ndusty pin-cushions--lean old hags like worn umbrellas with a quivering\nbonnet on top; young women, in muslins, with hats that might have grown\non hedges, and high pointed shoes; men in khaki, sailors, shabby clerks,\nyoung Jews in fine cloth suits with padded shoulders and wide trousers,\n\"hospital boys\" in blue--the sun discovers them--the loud, bold music\nholds them together in one big knot for a moment. The young ones are\nlarking, pushing each other on and off the pavement, dodging, nudging;\nthe old ones are talking: \"So I said to 'im, if you wants the doctor to\nyourself, fetch 'im, says I.\"\n\n\"An' by the time they was cooked there wasn't so much as you could put\nin the palm of me 'and!\"\n\nThe only ones who are quiet are the ragged children. They stand, as\nclose up to the musicians as they can get, their hands behind their\nbacks, their eyes big. Occasionally a leg hops, an arm wags. A tiny\nstaggerer, overcome, turns round twice, sits down solemn, and then gets\nup again.\n\n\"Ain't it lovely?\" whispers a small girl behind her hand.\n\nAnd the music breaks into bright pieces, and joins together again, and\nagain breaks, and is dissolved, and the crowd scatters, moving slowly up\nthe hill.\n\nAt the corner of the road the stalls begin.\n\n\"Ticklers! Tuppence a tickler! 'Ool 'ave a tickler? Tickle 'em up,\nboys.\" Little soft brooms on wire handles. They are eagerly bought by\nthe soldiers.\n\n\"Buy a golliwog! Tuppence a golliwog!\"\n\n\"Buy a jumping donkey! All alive-oh!\"\n\n\"Su-perior chewing gum. Buy something to do, boys.\"\n\n\"Buy a rose. Give 'er a rose, boy. Roses, lady?\"\n\n\"Fevvers! Fevvers!\" They are hard to resist. Lovely, streaming feathers,\nemerald green, scarlet, bright blue, canary yellow. Even the babies wear\nfeathers threaded through their bonnets.\n\nAnd an old woman in a three-cornered paper hat cries as if it were her\nfinal parting advice, the only way of saving yourself or of bringing him\nto his senses: \"Buy a three-cornered 'at, my dear, an' put it on!\"\n\nIt is a flying day, half sun, half wind. When the sun goes in a shadow\nflies over; when it comes out again it is fiery. The men and women feel\nit burning their backs, their breasts and their arms; they feel their\nbodies expanding, coming alive... so that they make large embracing\ngestures, lift up their arms, for nothing, swoop down on a girl, blurt\ninto laughter.\n\nLemonade! A whole tank of it stands on a table covered with a cloth;\nand lemons like blunted fishes blob in the yellow water. It looks solid,\nlike a jelly, in the thick glasses. Why can't they drink it without\nspilling it? Everybody spills it, and before the glass is handed back\nthe last drops are thrown in a ring.\n\nRound the ice-cream cart, with its striped awning and bright brass\ncover, the children cluster. Little tongues lick, lick round the cream\ntrumpets, round the squares. The cover is lifted, the wooden spoon\nplunges in; one shuts one's eyes to feel it, silently scrunching.\n\n\"Let these little birds tell you your future!\" She stands beside the\ncage, a shrivelled ageless Italian, clasping and unclasping her\ndark claws. Her face, a treasure of delicate carving, is tied in a\ngreen-and-gold scarf. And inside their prison the love-birds flutter\ntowards the papers in the seed-tray.\n\n\"You have great strength of character. You will marry a red-haired man\nand have three children. Beware of a blonde woman.\" Look out! Look\nout! A motor-car driven by a fat chauffeur comes rushing down the hill.\nInside there a blonde woman, pouting, leaning forward--rushing through\nyour life--beware! beware!\n\n\"Ladies and gentlemen, I am an auctioneer by profession, and if what I\ntell you is not the truth I am liable to have my licence taken away from\nme and a heavy imprisonment.\" He holds the licence across his chest; the\nsweat pours down his face into his paper collar; his eyes look glazed.\nWhen he takes off his hat there is a deep pucker of angry flesh on his\nforehead. Nobody buys a watch.\n\nLook out again! A huge barouche comes swinging down the hill with two\nold, old babies inside. She holds up a lace parasol; he sucks the knob\nof his cane, and the fat old bodies roll together as the cradle rocks,\nand the steaming horse leaves a trail of manure as it ambles down the\nhill.\n\nUnder a tree, Professor Leonard, in cap and gown, stands beside his\nbanner. He is here \"for one day,\" from the London, Paris and Brussels\nExhibition, to tell your fortune from your face. And he stands, smiling\nencouragement, like a clumsy dentist. When the big men, romping and\nswearing a moment before, hand across their sixpence, and stand before\nhim, they are suddenly serious, dumb, timid, almost blushing as the\nProfessor's quick hand notches the printed card. They are like little\nchildren caught playing in a forbidden garden by the owner, stepping\nfrom behind a tree.\n\nThe top of the hill is reached. How hot it is! How fine it is! The\npublic-house is open, and the crowd presses in. The mother sits on the\npavement edge with her baby, and the father brings her out a glass of\ndark, brownish stuff, and then savagely elbows his way in again. A reek\nof beer floats from the public-house, and a loud clatter and rattle of\nvoices.\n\nThe wind has dropped, and the sun burns more fiercely than ever. Outside\nthe two swing-doors there is a thick mass of children like flies at the\nmouth of a sweet-jar.\n\nAnd up, up the hill come the people, with ticklers and golliwogs,\nand roses and feathers. Up, up they thrust into the light and heat,\nshouting, laughing, squealing, as though they were being pushed by\nsomething, far below, and by the sun, far ahead of them--drawn up into\nthe full, bright, dazzling radiance to... what?\n\n\n\n\n</CHAPTER>\n"}, {"id": 14, "text": "<CHAPTER>\n14. AN IDEAL FAMILY.\n\nThat evening for the first time in his life, as he pressed through the\nswing door and descended the three broad steps to the pavement, old\nMr. Neave felt he was too old for the spring. Spring--warm, eager,\nrestless--was there, waiting for him in the golden light, ready in front\nof everybody to run up, to blow in his white beard, to drag sweetly on\nhis arm. And he couldn't meet her, no; he couldn't square up once more\nand stride off, jaunty as a young man. He was tired and, although the\nlate sun was still shining, curiously cold, with a numbed feeling all\nover. Quite suddenly he hadn't the energy, he hadn't the heart to stand\nthis gaiety and bright movement any longer; it confused him. He wanted\nto stand still, to wave it away with his stick, to say, \"Be off with\nyou!\" Suddenly it was a terrible effort to greet as usual--tipping his\nwide-awake with his stick--all the people whom he knew, the friends,\nacquaintances, shopkeepers, postmen, drivers. But the gay glance that\nwent with the gesture, the kindly twinkle that seemed to say, \"I'm a\nmatch and more for any of you\"--that old Mr. Neave could not manage\nat all. He stumped along, lifting his knees high as if he were walking\nthrough air that had somehow grown heavy and solid like water. And the\nhomeward-looking crowd hurried by, the trams clanked, the light carts\nclattered, the big swinging cabs bowled along with that reckless,\ndefiant indifference that one knows only in dreams...\n\nIt had been a day like other days at the office. Nothing special had\nhappened. Harold hadn't come back from lunch until close on four. Where\nhad he been? What had he been up to? He wasn't going to let his father\nknow. Old Mr. Neave had happened to be in the vestibule, saying good-bye\nto a caller, when Harold sauntered in, perfectly turned out as usual,\ncool, suave, smiling that peculiar little half-smile that women found so\nfascinating.\n\nAh, Harold was too handsome, too handsome by far; that had been the\ntrouble all along. No man had a right to such eyes, such lashes, and\nsuch lips; it was uncanny. As for his mother, his sisters, and the\nservants, it was not too much to say they made a young god of him; they\nworshipped Harold, they forgave him everything; and he had needed some\nforgiving ever since the time when he was thirteen and he had stolen\nhis mother's purse, taken the money, and hidden the purse in the cook's\nbedroom. Old Mr. Neave struck sharply with his stick upon the pavement\nedge. But it wasn't only his family who spoiled Harold, he reflected,\nit was everybody; he had only to look and to smile, and down they went\nbefore him. So perhaps it wasn't to be wondered at that he expected the\noffice to carry on the tradition. H'm, h'm! But it couldn't be done. No\nbusiness--not even a successful, established, big paying concern--could\nbe played with. A man had either to put his whole heart and soul into\nit, or it went all to pieces before his eyes...\n\nAnd then Charlotte and the girls were always at him to make the whole\nthing over to Harold, to retire, and to spend his time enjoying himself.\nEnjoying himself! Old Mr. Neave stopped dead under a group of ancient\ncabbage palms outside the Government buildings! Enjoying himself! The\nwind of evening shook the dark leaves to a thin airy cackle. Sitting at\nhome, twiddling his thumbs, conscious all the while that his life's\nwork was slipping away, dissolving, disappearing through Harold's fine\nfingers, while Harold smiled...\n\n\"Why will you be so unreasonable, father? There's absolutely no need\nfor you to go to the office. It only makes it very awkward for us when\npeople persist in saying how tired you're looking. Here's this huge\nhouse and garden. Surely you could be happy in--in--appreciating it for\na change. Or you could take up some hobby.\"\n\nAnd Lola the baby had chimed in loftily, \"All men ought to have hobbies.\nIt makes life impossible if they haven't.\"\n\nWell, well! He couldn't help a grim smile as painfully he began to climb\nthe hill that led into Harcourt Avenue. Where would Lola and her sisters\nand Charlotte be if he'd gone in for hobbies, he'd like to know? Hobbies\ncouldn't pay for the town house and the seaside bungalow, and their\nhorses, and their golf, and the sixty-guinea gramophone in the\nmusic-room for them to dance to. Not that he grudged them these things.\nNo, they were smart, good-looking girls, and Charlotte was a remarkable\nwoman; it was natural for them to be in the swim. As a matter of fact,\nno other house in the town was as popular as theirs; no other family\nentertained so much. And how many times old Mr. Neave, pushing the cigar\nbox across the smoking-room table, had listened to praises of his wife,\nhis girls, of himself even.\n\n\"You're an ideal family, sir, an ideal family. It's like something one\nreads about or sees on the stage.\"\n\n\"That's all right, my boy,\" old Mr. Neave would reply. \"Try one of\nthose; I think you'll like them. And if you care to smoke in the garden,\nyou'll find the girls on the lawn, I dare say.\"\n\nThat was why the girls had never married, so people said. They could\nhave married anybody. But they had too good a time at home. They were\ntoo happy together, the girls and Charlotte. H'm, h'm! Well, well.\nPerhaps so...\n\nBy this time he had walked the length of fashionable Harcourt Avenue;\nhe had reached the corner house, their house. The carriage gates were\npushed back; there were fresh marks of wheels on the drive. And then he\nfaced the big white-painted house, with its wide-open windows, its tulle\ncurtains floating outwards, its blue jars of hyacinths on the broad\nsills. On either side of the carriage porch their hydrangeas--famous in\nthe town--were coming into flower; the pinkish, bluish masses of flower\nlay like light among the spreading leaves. And somehow, it seemed to old\nMr. Neave that the house and the flowers, and even the fresh marks on\nthe drive, were saying, \"There is young life here. There are girls--\"\n\nThe hall, as always, was dusky with wraps, parasols, gloves, piled on\nthe oak chests. From the music-room sounded the piano, quick, loud and\nimpatient. Through the drawing-room door that was ajar voices floated.\n\n\"And were there ices?\" came from Charlotte. Then the creak, creak of her\nrocker.\n\n\"Ices!\" cried Ethel. \"My dear mother, you never saw such ices. Only two\nkinds. And one a common little strawberry shop ice, in a sopping wet\nfrill.\"\n\n\"The food altogether was too appalling,\" came from Marion.\n\n\"Still, it's rather early for ices,\" said Charlotte easily.\n\n\"But why, if one has them at all... \" began Ethel.\n\n\"Oh, quite so, darling,\" crooned Charlotte.\n\nSuddenly the music-room door opened and Lola dashed out. She started,\nshe nearly screamed, at the sight of old Mr. Neave.\n\n\"Gracious, father! What a fright you gave me! Have you just come home?\nWhy isn't Charles here to help you off with your coat?\"\n\nHer cheeks were crimson from playing, her eyes glittered, the hair\nfell over her forehead. And she breathed as though she had come running\nthrough the dark and was frightened. Old Mr. Neave stared at his\nyoungest daughter; he felt he had never seen her before. So that was\nLola, was it? But she seemed to have forgotten her father; it was not\nfor him that she was waiting there. Now she put the tip of her crumpled\nhandkerchief between her teeth and tugged at it angrily. The telephone\nrang. A-ah! Lola gave a cry like a sob and dashed past him. The door of\nthe telephone-room slammed, and at the same moment Charlotte called, \"Is\nthat you, father?\"\n\n\"You're tired again,\" said Charlotte reproachfully, and she stopped the\nrocker and offered her warm plum-like cheek. Bright-haired Ethel pecked\nhis beard, Marion's lips brushed his ear.\n\n\"Did you walk back, father?\" asked Charlotte.\n\n\"Yes, I walked home,\" said old Mr. Neave, and he sank into one of the\nimmense drawing-room chairs.\n\n\"But why didn't you take a cab?\" said Ethel. \"There are hundred of cabs\nabout at that time.\"\n\n\"My dear Ethel,\" cried Marion, \"if father prefers to tire himself out, I\nreally don't see what business of ours it is to interfere.\"\n\n\"Children, children?\" coaxed Charlotte.\n\nBut Marion wouldn't be stopped. \"No, mother, you spoil father, and it's\nnot right. You ought to be stricter with him. He's very naughty.\" She\nlaughed her hard, bright laugh and patted her hair in a mirror. Strange!\nWhen she was a little girl she had such a soft, hesitating voice; she\nhad even stuttered, and now, whatever she said--even if it was only\n\"Jam, please, father\"--it rang out as though she were on the stage.\n\n\"Did Harold leave the office before you, dear?\" asked Charlotte,\nbeginning to rock again.\n\n\"I'm not sure,\" said Old Mr. Neave. \"I'm not sure. I didn't see him\nafter four o'clock.\"\n\n\"He said--\" began Charlotte.\n\nBut at that moment Ethel, who was twitching over the leaves of some\npaper or other, ran to her mother and sank down beside her chair.\n\n\"There, you see,\" she cried. \"That's what I mean, mummy. Yellow, with\ntouches of silver. Don't you agree?\"\n\n\"Give it to me, love,\" said Charlotte. She fumbled for her\ntortoise-shell spectacles and put them on, gave the page a little dab\nwith her plump small fingers, and pursed up her lips. \"Very sweet!\"\nshe crooned vaguely; she looked at Ethel over her spectacles. \"But I\nshouldn't have the train.\"\n\n\"Not the train!\" wailed Ethel tragically. \"But the train's the whole\npoint.\"\n\n\"Here, mother, let me decide.\" Marion snatched the paper playfully from\nCharlotte. \"I agree with mother,\" she cried triumphantly. \"The train\noverweights it.\"\n\nOld Mr. Neave, forgotten, sank into the broad lap of his chair, and,\ndozing, heard them as though he dreamed. There was no doubt about it, he\nwas tired out; he had lost his hold. Even Charlotte and the girls were\ntoo much for him to-night. They were too... too... But all his drowsing\nbrain could think of was--too rich for him. And somewhere at the back\nof everything he was watching a little withered ancient man climbing up\nendless flights of stairs. Who was he?\n\n\"I shan't dress to-night,\" he muttered.\n\n\"What do you say, father?\"\n\n\"Eh, what, what?\" Old Mr. Neave woke with a start and stared across at\nthem. \"I shan't dress to-night,\" he repeated.\n\n\"But, father, we've got Lucile coming, and Henry Davenport, and Mrs.\nTeddie Walker.\"\n\n\"It will look so very out of the picture.\"\n\n\"Don't you feel well, dear?\"\n\n\"You needn't make any effort. What is Charles for?\"\n\n\"But if you're really not up to it,\" Charlotte wavered.\n\n\"Very well! Very well!\" Old Mr. Neave got up and went to join that\nlittle old climbing fellow just as far as his dressing-room...\n\nThere young Charles was waiting for him. Carefully, as though everything\ndepended on it, he was tucking a towel round the hot-water can. Young\nCharles had been a favourite of his ever since as a little red-faced\nboy he had come into the house to look after the fires. Old Mr. Neave\nlowered himself into the cane lounge by the window, stretched out his\nlegs, and made his little evening joke, \"Dress him up, Charles!\" And\nCharles, breathing intensely and frowning, bent forward to take the pin\nout of his tie.\n\nH'm, h'm! Well, well! It was pleasant by the open window, very\npleasant--a fine mild evening. They were cutting the grass on the tennis\ncourt below; he heard the soft churr of the mower. Soon the girls would\nbegin their tennis parties again. And at the thought he seemed to\nhear Marion's voice ring out, \"Good for you, partner... Oh, played,\npartner... Oh, very nice indeed.\" Then Charlotte calling from the\nveranda, \"Where is Harold?\" And Ethel, \"He's certainly not here,\nmother.\" And Charlotte's vague, \"He said--\"\n\nOld Mr. Neave sighed, got up, and putting one hand under his beard, he\ntook the comb from young Charles, and carefully combed the white beard\nover. Charles gave him a folded handkerchief, his watch and seals, and\nspectacle case.\n\n\"That will do, my lad.\" The door shut, he sank back, he was alone...\n\nAnd now that little ancient fellow was climbing down endless flights\nthat led to a glittering, gay dining-room. What legs he had! They were\nlike a spider's--thin, withered.\n\n\"You're an ideal family, sir, an ideal family.\"\n\nBut if that were true, why didn't Charlotte or the girls stop him? Why\nwas he all alone, climbing up and down? Where was Harold? Ah, it was\nno good expecting anything from Harold. Down, down went the little old\nspider, and then, to his horror, old Mr. Neave saw him slip past the\ndining-room and make for the porch, the dark drive, the carriage gates,\nthe office. Stop him, stop him, somebody!\n\nOld Mr. Neave started up. It was dark in his dressing-room; the window\nshone pale. How long had he been asleep? He listened, and through\nthe big, airy, darkened house there floated far-away voices, far-away\nsounds. Perhaps, he thought vaguely, he had been asleep for a long time.\nHe'd been forgotten. What had all this to do with him--this house and\nCharlotte, the girls and Harold--what did he know about them? They were\nstrangers to him. Life had passed him by. Charlotte was not his wife.\nHis wife!\n\n... A dark porch, half hidden by a passion-vine, that drooped sorrowful,\nmournful, as though it understood. Small, warm arms were round his neck.\nA face, little and pale, lifted to his, and a voice breathed, \"Good-bye,\nmy treasure.\"\n\nMy treasure! \"Good-bye, my treasure!\" Which of them had spoken? Why had\nthey said good-bye? There had been some terrible mistake. She was his\nwife, that little pale girl, and all the rest of his life had been a\ndream.\n\nThen the door opened, and young Charles, standing in the light, put his\nhands by his side and shouted like a young soldier, \"Dinner is on the\ntable, sir!\"\n\n\"I'm coming, I'm coming,\" said old Mr. Neave.\n\n\n\n\n</CHAPTER>\n"}, {"id": 15, "text": "<CHAPTER>\n15. THE LADY'S MAID.\n\nEleven o'clock. A knock at the door... I hope I haven't disturbed you,\nmadam. You weren't asleep--were you? But I've just given my lady her\ntea, and there was such a nice cup over, I thought, perhaps...\n\n... Not at all, madam. I always make a cup of tea last thing. She drinks\nit in bed after her prayers to warm her up. I put the kettle on when she\nkneels down and I say to it, \"Now you needn't be in too much of a hurry\nto say your prayers.\" But it's always boiling before my lady is half\nthrough. You see, madam, we know such a lot of people, and they've all\ngot to be prayed for--every one. My lady keeps a list of the names in a\nlittle red book. Oh dear! whenever some one new has been to see us and\nmy lady says afterwards, \"Ellen, give me my little red book,\" I feel\nquite wild, I do. \"There's another,\" I think, \"keeping her out of her\nbed in all weathers.\" And she won't have a cushion, you know, madam; she\nkneels on the hard carpet. It fidgets me something dreadful to see\nher, knowing her as I do. I've tried to cheat her; I've spread out\nthe eiderdown. But the first time I did it--oh, she gave me such a\nlook--holy it was, madam. \"Did our Lord have an eiderdown, Ellen?\" she\nsaid. But--I was younger at the time--I felt inclined to say, \"No, but\nour Lord wasn't your age, and he didn't know what it was to have your\nlumbago.\" Wicked--wasn't it? But she's too good, you know, madam. When\nI tucked her up just now and seen--saw her lying back, her hands outside\nand her head on the pillow--so pretty--I couldn't help thinking, \"Now\nyou look just like your dear mother when I laid her out!\"\n\n... Yes, madam, it was all left to me. Oh, she did look sweet. I did her\nhair, soft-like, round her forehead, all in dainty curls, and just to\none side of her neck I put a bunch of most beautiful purple pansies.\nThose pansies made a picture of her, madam! I shall never forget them.\nI thought to-night, when I looked at my lady, \"Now, if only the pansies\nwas there no one could tell the difference.\"\n\n... Only the last year, madam. Only after she'd got a\nlittle--well--feeble as you might say. Of course, she was never\ndangerous; she was the sweetest old lady. But how it took her was--she\nthought she'd lost something. She couldn't keep still, she couldn't\nsettle. All day long she'd be up and down, up and down; you'd meet her\neverywhere,--on the stairs, in the porch, making for the kitchen. And\nshe'd look up at you, and she'd say--just like a child, \"I've lost it,\nI've lost it.\" \"Come along,\" I'd say, \"come along, and I'll lay out your\npatience for you.\" But she'd catch me by the hand--I was a favourite of\nhers--and whisper, \"Find it for me, Ellen. Find it for me.\" Sad, wasn't\nit?\n\n... No, she never recovered, madam. She had a stroke at the end. Last\nwords she ever said was--very slow, \"Look in--the--Look--in--\" And then\nshe was gone.\n\n... No, madam, I can't say I noticed it. Perhaps some girls. But you\nsee, it's like this, I've got nobody but my lady. My mother died of\nconsumption when I was four, and I lived with my grandfather, who kept\na hair-dresser's shop. I used to spend all my time in the shop under a\ntable dressing my doll's hair--copying the assistants, I suppose. They\nwere ever so kind to me. Used to make me little wigs, all colours, the\nlatest fashions and all. And there I'd sit all day, quiet as quiet--the\ncustomers never knew. Only now and again I'd take my peep from under the\ntable-cloth.\n\n... But one day I managed to get a pair of scissors and--would you\nbelieve it, madam? I cut off all my hair; snipped it off all in bits,\nlike the little monkey I was. Grandfather was furious! He caught hold of\nthe tongs--I shall never forget it--grabbed me by the hand and shut my\nfingers in them. \"That'll teach you!\" he said. It was a fearful burn.\nI've got the mark of it to-day.\n\n... Well, you see, madam, he'd taken such pride in my hair. He used to\nsit me up on the counter, before the customers came, and do it something\nbeautiful--big, soft curls and waved over the top. I remember the\nassistants standing round, and me ever so solemn with the penny\ngrandfather gave me to hold while it was being done... But he always took\nthe penny back afterwards. Poor grandfather! Wild, he was, at the fright\nI'd made of myself. But he frightened me that time. Do you know what\nI did, madam? I ran away. Yes, I did, round the corners, in and out, I\ndon't know how far I didn't run. Oh, dear, I must have looked a sight,\nwith my hand rolled up in my pinny and my hair sticking out. People must\nhave laughed when they saw me...\n\n... No, madam, grandfather never got over it. He couldn't bear the sight\nof me after. Couldn't eat his dinner, even, if I was there. So my aunt\ntook me. She was a cripple, an upholstress. Tiny! She had to stand on\nthe sofas when she wanted to cut out the backs. And it was helping her I\nmet my lady...\n\n... Not so very, madam. I was thirteen, turned. And I don't remember ever\nfeeling--well--a child, as you might say. You see there was my uniform,\nand one thing and another. My lady put me into collars and cuffs from\nthe first. Oh yes--once I did! That was--funny! It was like this. My\nlady had her two little nieces staying with her--we were at Sheldon at\nthe time--and there was a fair on the common.\n\n\"Now, Ellen,\" she said, \"I want you to take the two young ladies for a\nride on the donkeys.\" Off we went; solemn little loves they were; each\nhad a hand. But when we came to the donkeys they were too shy to go on.\nSo we stood and watched instead. Beautiful those donkeys were! They were\nthe first I'd seen out of a cart--for pleasure as you might say. They\nwere a lovely silver-grey, with little red saddles and blue bridles and\nbells jing-a-jingling on their ears. And quite big girls--older than me,\neven--were riding them, ever so gay. Not at all common, I don't mean,\nmadam, just enjoying themselves. And I don't know what it was, but\nthe way the little feet went, and the eyes--so gentle--and the soft\nears--made me want to go on a donkey more than anything in the world!\n\n... Of course, I couldn't. I had my young ladies. And what would I have\nlooked like perched up there in my uniform? But all the rest of the day\nit was donkeys--donkeys on the brain with me. I felt I should have burst\nif I didn't tell some one; and who was there to tell? But when I went to\nbed--I was sleeping in Mrs. James's bedroom, our cook that was, at\nthe time--as soon as the lights was out, there they were, my donkeys,\njingling along, with their neat little feet and sad eyes... Well, madam,\nwould you believe it, I waited for a long time and pretended to be\nasleep, and then suddenly I sat up and called out as loud as I could, \"I\ndo want to go on a donkey. I do want a donkey-ride!\" You see, I had to\nsay it, and I thought they wouldn't laugh at me if they knew I was only\ndreaming. Artful--wasn't it? Just what a silly child would think...\n\n... No, madam, never now. Of course, I did think of it at one time. But\nit wasn't to be. He had a little flower-shop just down the road and\nacross from where we was living. Funny--wasn't it? And me such a one for\nflowers. We were having a lot of company at the time, and I was in and\nout of the shop more often than not, as the saying is. And Harry and\nI (his name was Harry) got to quarrelling about how things ought to be\narranged--and that began it. Flowers! you wouldn't believe it,\nmadam, the flowers he used to bring me. He'd stop at nothing. It was\nlilies-of-the-valley more than once, and I'm not exaggerating! Well, of\ncourse, we were going to be married and live over the shop, and it was\nall going to be just so, and I was to have the window to arrange... Oh,\nhow I've done that window of a Saturday! Not really, of course, madam,\njust dreaming, as you might say. I've done it for Christmas--motto in\nholly, and all--and I've had my Easter lilies with a gorgeous star all\ndaffodils in the middle. I've hung--well, that's enough of that. The day\ncame he was to call for me to choose the furniture. Shall I ever forget\nit? It was a Tuesday. My lady wasn't quite herself that afternoon. Not\nthat she'd said anything, of course; she never does or will. But I knew\nby the way that she kept wrapping herself up and asking me if it was\ncold--and her little nose looked... pinched. I didn't like leaving her; I\nknew I'd be worrying all the time. At last I asked her if she'd rather\nI put it off. \"Oh no, Ellen,\" she said, \"you mustn't mind about me. You\nmustn't disappoint your young man.\" And so cheerful, you know, madam,\nnever thinking about herself. It made me feel worse than ever. I began\nto wonder... then she dropped her handkerchief and began to stoop down to\npick it up herself--a thing she never did. \"Whatever are you doing!\" I\ncried, running to stop her. \"Well,\" she said, smiling, you know, madam,\n\"I shall have to begin to practise.\" Oh, it was all I could do not to\nburst out crying. I went over to the dressing-table and made believe\nto rub up the silver, and I couldn't keep myself in, and I asked her if\nshe'd rather I... didn't get married. \"No, Ellen,\" she said--that was her\nvoice, madam, like I'm giving you--\"No, Ellen, not for the wide world!\"\nBut while she said it, madam--I was looking in her glass; of course, she\ndidn't know I could see her--she put her little hand on her heart just\nlike her dear mother used to, and lifted her eyes... Oh, madam!\n\nWhen Harry came I had his letters all ready, and the ring and a ducky\nlittle brooch he'd given me--a silver bird it was, with a chain in\nits beak, and on the end of the chain a heart with a dagger. Quite\nthe thing! I opened the door to him. I never gave him time for a word.\n\"There you are,\" I said. \"Take them all back,\" I said, \"it's all over.\nI'm not going to marry you,\" I said, \"I can't leave my lady.\" White! he\nturned as white as a woman. I had to slam the door, and there I\nstood, all of a tremble, till I knew he had gone. When I opened the\ndoor--believe me or not, madam--that man was gone! I ran out into the\nroad just as I was, in my apron and my house-shoes, and there I stayed\nin the middle of the road... staring. People must have laughed if they\nsaw me...\n\n... Goodness gracious!--What's that? It's the clock striking! And here\nI've been keeping you awake. Oh, madam, you ought to have stopped\nme... Can I tuck in your feet? I always tuck in my lady's feet, every\nnight, just the same. And she says, \"Good night, Ellen. Sleep sound and\nwake early!\" I don't know what I should do if she didn't say that, now.\n\n... Oh dear, I sometimes think... whatever should I do if anything were\nto... But, there, thinking's no good to any one--is it, madam? Thinking\nwon't help. Not that I do it often. And if ever I do I pull myself up\nsharp, \"Now, then, Ellen. At it again--you silly girl! If you can't find\nanything better to do than to start thinking!... \"\n\n</CHAPTER>\n"}], "book_id": "1429-chapters"}
